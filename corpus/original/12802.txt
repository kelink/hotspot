(Reuters) - India's new foreign secretary is facing a huge challenge of how to improve relations with Pakistan after the Mumbai attacks as political opposition grows at home that the government is appeasing its nuclear-armed neighbour. (To read an analysis, double-click [ID:nISL484528])
Following is a brief profile of the key people driving India's foreign policy which has come in for a huge test since November's attacks in which 175 people were killed.
MANMOHAN SINGH, Prime Minister
A career technocrat, Singh, 76, acquired his global orientation working at various international organisations, including the United Nations, making him a less insular prime minister than many of his predecessors.
A landmark civilian nuclear deal with the United States remains the highpoint of his foreign policy, yet what could determine his legacy is his handling of relations with Pakistan.
Singh's critics say he has too many things on his plate to focus on geopolitics and point to his traditional interest on economic rather than foreign policy issues. M.K. NARAYANAN, National Security Adviser
Narayanan, 75, seen as close to Singh, has no background in foreign affairs and comes from the national police service.
He was the chief of India's internal intelligence agency, a qualification that may stand him in good stead when it comes to analysing intelligence inputs from foreign countries.
But critics say that his police background gives a tunnel vision, impeding a wider understanding of geopolitics.
