(Reuters) - China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) is expected to issue $1 billion in dollar-denominated three-year corporate bills on Monday at a coupon of about 63 basis points over six-month London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), traders said.
That spread would be wider than the 50 bps-over-Libor coupon paid on the two-year dollar-denominated floating-rate bonds issued by China Development Bank at the end of 2008, reflecting CDB's policy bank status and its bond's shorter tenor.
But traders calculated that such a spread would be about equivalent to the 2.6 to 2.7 percent secondary market yield for CNPC's yuan-denominated three-year fixed-rate medium-term bills.
