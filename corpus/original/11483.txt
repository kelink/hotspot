(Reuters) - China Construction Bank (
), the country's second-largest lender by assets, beat forecasts with an 11.7 percent jump in second-quarter profit, as loans soared under Beijing's economic stimulus plan.
), in which Bank of America (
) has about an 11 percent stake, said on Friday there was also an encouraging development in net interest margins, the major source of profits for Chinese banks.
"With the gradual economic recovery, the bottoming out of market rates and the shrinking time lag between repricing of deposits and lending, decrease in net interest margin had slowed down notably," the bank said.
The state-controlled lender earned 29.6 billion yuan ($4.33 billion) in April-June, up from 26.5 billion a year earlier and beating analysts' average forecast of 27.6 billion in a Reuters poll.
The bank's total outstanding loans and advances surged almost 20 percent from December to 4.4 trillion yuan, offsetting a decline in net interest margin, which narrowed to 2.46 percent at end June from 3.29 percent a year earlier.
"In the first half, most lending went to infrastructure projects, (in) which China Construction Bank is traditionally very competitive," Joe Lu, an analyst with BOCOM International.
Chinese bank lending jumped in response to Beijing's 4 trillion yuan economic stimulus programme, but their interest margins were squeezed by looser monetary policies.
), the world's biggest bank by market value, posted on Thursday broadly flat quarterly earnings, but beat forecasts on the back of a surge in lending. [ID:nPEK347672]
Construction Bank's net interest income fell 7 percent to 102.5 billion yuan in the first half.
The bank's non-performing loan ratio edged down to 1.71 percent, from 2.21 percent at the end of December.
Shares in Construction Bank have risen about 40 percent in Hong Kong so far this year, on par with the increase in the benchmark Hang Seng Index
