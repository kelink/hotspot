"This is impossible," the source told Reuters, referring to the compensation amount suggested by the TSMC lawyer.
SMIC, which has a market capitalisation of HK$8.5 billion ($1.10 billion), should have a result next week on the compensation amount from its negotiations with TSMC, the source said late on Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the situation's sensitivity.
The jury is expected to consider damages next week, the TSMC lawyer said.
Another source close to SMIC said the company aimed to reach a settlement by early next week, and hoped for a resumption of trading in its shares by next Wednesday.
The second source added that SMIC was trying to keep the final settlement amount in a similar range to another case several years ago between the two companies. In that case, unrelated to the current one, SMIC paid TSMC $175 million to settle claims of intellectual property theft.
TSMC accused SMIC of hiring away about 180 TSMC employees to staff SMIC's Shanghai operations in 2000, and of telling new hires to bring documents showing how to set up a foundry, make chips and other design rules from TSMC.
