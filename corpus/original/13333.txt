(Reuters) - At least 160 Britons are being held in quarantine abroad because they are suspected of having the H1N1 flu virus, the Foreign Office said on Friday.
The Britons, a mixture of adults and children, are being held in China, Singapore, India and Egypt.
The actual number could be higher because some Britons are likely to be held in quarantine without getting in touch with the Foreign Office, it said.
"We are paying close attention to the welfare of Britons in quarantine," a spokeswoman said in a statement.
"We are keeping in touch by phone with those in quarantine to check on their welfare; ensure they understand the procedures; and to pass messages to and from parents/relatives in the UK."
"Where we can we are also helping Britons in quarantine by arranging delivery of clothes; food; drinking water; and books/magazines to relieve the boredom," the spokeswoman said.
"Where necessary, in a few cases, we have taken up concerns on their behalf."
One remains in hospital in Beijing while another three are in hospital in Hangzhou, near Shanghai.
The pandemic has killed about 430 people worldwide, with Britain one of the worst countries affected. At least 30 people have died in Britain after contracting H1N1.
On Thursday, British authorities said the number of estimated cases in England had nearly doubled on the previous week to 100,000. (Reporting by Avril Ormsby; Editing by Keith Weir)
