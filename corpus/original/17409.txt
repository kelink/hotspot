), Korea's KT Corporation (
); Japan's NTT Communications (

The planned cable system, for operation by 2011, would span about 8,000 kilometres and would use the latest dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) technologies with a minimum design capacity of 4 terabits per second, PLDT said in a statement.
"The proposed cable system has the potential to provide an alternative route and or restoration paths to existing cable systems in the region as it is designed to provide a high-degree of interconnectivity with existing and planned high bandwidth systems," the statement said.
PLDT, along with other Asian and U.S.-based telecoms operators, is also building a $550-million fibre optic cable network spanning 20,000 kilometres to connect the region with U.S. territories in the Pacific and West Coast. (Reporting by Rosemarie Francisco; Editing by Lincoln Feast)
