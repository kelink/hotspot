Two new cases were reported in Shanghai, a 47-year-old Chinese woman and a 24-year-old Frenchman, said Chen Qiwei, a spokesman for the municipal government.
In Fuzhou, capital of the southeastern province of Fujian, a two-year-old Chinese girl was confirmed infected with H1N1 flu, the provincial health department said.
