(Reuters) - Natixis Global Asset Management (NGAM) (
), among the world's top 20 fund firms, expects Taiwan's offshore fund market to grow 15-20 percent in 2010 from about $65 billion now, as the island benefits from closer financial ties with China, a top executive said.
The French asset manager, aiming to cash in on improving cross-strait ties, will open a new Taiwan subsidiary -- its third Asia-based office after Japan and Singapore, and its first new regional office in 13 years.
Taiwan's roughly $52 billion fund market, one of the largest in Asia, is packed with global names including ING (
) Funds, BlackRock (
), Prudential Financial (
), UBS (
), which are locked in tight competition to serve the island's investors.
"Taiwan is a strong individual market. We believe it's a great gateway into Asia," John Hailer, NGAM's company president and chief executive said at a ceremony in Taipei on Thursday.
"The MOU with China could give Taiwan's financial industry more preferred treatments than what Hong Kong had got," Hailer added.
Taiwan is expected to sign a much-anticipated financial services pact with China within the month, a Taiwan government official said earlier this week, in the latest sign of easing trade ties across the Taiwan strait following a decades-long freeze. [ID:nTP166124]
