(Reuters) - China's Everbright Securities, a mid-sized brokerage, received approval for its initial public offering from regulators and hopes to raise more than 10 billion yuan ($1.46 billion), official media said on Saturday.
Everbright would become the first listed brokerage in the country after the China Securities Regulatory Commission resumed IPOs in June, the China Securities Journal said.
The share listing was scheduled for next week and would offer 520 million A shares at between 15 and 20 yuan per share, said the newspaper.
China Everbright Bank, the parent company of Everbright Securities, announced on July 22 that it planned to raise 11 billion yuan through private placement with some large state-owned enterprises to lift its capital adequacy ratio.
Other brokerages, such as China Merchants Securities, are also considering IPOs as China's generally booming stock market over the past several years is offering the firms good opportunities for expansion.
Industrial Securities was also eyeing a 5 billion yuan share offering, magazine Caijing reported on Thursday.
China has eight listed brokerages, but only one, CITIC Securities (
), went public by floating IPO shares.
Six others chose back-door listings via acquisitions of listed companies and the other transformed itself into a brokerage from its previous life as a trust firm. ($=6.83 yuan) (Reporting by Kirby Chien; Editing by Nick Macfie)
