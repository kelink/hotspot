(Reuters) - Hong Kong-based consumer goods exporter Li & Fung (
) said on Monday it will pay up to $402 million to buy a U.S. young men's and children's apparel business, as part of its effort to expand overseas.
Li & Fung's purchase of U.S.-based Wear Me Group will also benefit the company's brands and private label businesses, it said in a statement.
The company, whose customers include U.S. retail giants Wal-Mart (
), is relying on acquisitions and new outsourcing deals to meet expansion targets.
The company, whose president is former American competitive tennis player Bruce Rockowitz, has set a three-year plan from 2008-2010 with targets including annual turnover of $20 billion, and a core operating profit of $1 billion. Turnover in the first half of 2009 totaled HK$46.3 billion ($6 billion).
"We will continue to pursue our acquisition strategy and this deal is only one of the many opportunities that we are currently looking at," Rockowitz, also executive director, said in the statement.
