) and Canadian-Austrian auto parts maker Magna MGa.TO are seen as front-runners to take over the unit of the floundering U.S. carmaker, with Belgium-listed private equity investor RHJ International (
On Tuesday, details emerged of a bid by China's BAIC.
Fresh from signing an agreement with Chrysler, Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne revealed plans to create a European auto giant. Marchionne has spoken out about Fiat's need to find a partner to gain the scale needed to survive the crisis.
Under the "Phoenix" plan, Fiat -- Europe's sixth-largest carmaker by sales in 2008 -- wants to combine GM Europe's Opel, Vauxhall and Saab brands, GM Mercosul (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay) and GM South Africa with Fiat group brands Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Lancia and LCV.
Combined proforma revenue could grow to 58 billion euros in 2010, and 65.3 billion by 2014, with recurring savings of 1.4 billion euros after 2015.
Fiat says the combined entity will need funding of about 7 billion euros over the next two years, assuming no cash or financial debt contributions from Fiat or GM. The plan will mean finding "another production mission within Fiat Group" for its Termini Imerese plant, and "another mission" for the Luton plant in the UK.
Magna has teamed up with Russian bank Sberbank Rossii, with carmaker GAZ (
) on board as industrial partner in a plan that would see an investment of up to 700 million euros in Opel, with credit lines also guaranteed by the German government.
Magna wants Opel and GM to gain 20 percent of the Russian market in the short term, and eventually sell 1 million units there. Magna wants to leave existing GM Europe managers to run the new group and has pledged to keep all four Opel plants in Germany, where politicians face a federal election in September.
The company has promised to look at ways to keep other European plants -- in the UK and Belgium -- open, including the possibility of bringing in third-party carmakers to the sites.
Under Magna's plan, GM would keep a 35 percent equity stake in Opel, Sberbank would get 35 percent, Magna would take 20 percent and Opel's employees would have 10 percent.
Chinese carmaker Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co (BAIC) has submitted an offer to buy Opel, a source close to BAIC told Reuters on Tuesday.
BAIC's plan envisions preserving all four Opel plants in Germany for at least two years and foresees no job cuts in the country, a financial source said, adding the concept called for less than 5 billion euros in state aid.
