A potential row is looming as GM appears to prefer the bid from private equity firm RHJ International, while Germany favors that led by Canadian auto supplier Magna. China's Beijing Automotive (BAIC) has also bid.
Following are details on the bidders' plans for Opel:
Wants to expand its car assembly business and plans to use some Opel plants to assemble models for other car companies. It forecasts high growth rates, particularly in Russia, home of its consortium partners Sberbank and GAZ.
Around 10,000 of the total 50,000 jobs across Europe would be cut, with 25 percent of the job losses in Germany.
Could close Belgium's Antwerp and Britain's Luton plants.
Shrink Opel production to return the company to profit. Could sell on the company in the future, possibly even back to
RHJ to hold 50.1 percent stake, while GM retains 39.9 percent. The remaining 10 percent would be held by workers.
To pay 175 million euros at the closing of the deal plus 100 million euros on December 31, 2012
To cut about 10,000 jobs throughout Europe, of which 8,100 are in manufacturing
To close Antwerp by March 2010 and mothball Germany's Eisenach for next two years
Around 7,600 jobs would be cut Europe-wide, including 3,000 in Germany.
