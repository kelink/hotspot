Gindalbie's shareholders in February backed a share placement to Anshan to fund development of the Karara iron ore mine, which would take Anshan's stake to 36.28 percent from 12.6 percent now.
The government's approval, announced by Treasurer Wayne Swan on Friday, was "absolutely fundamental" to getting the project, estimated to cost $1 billion off the ground, said Gindalbie Chairman George Jones.
As part of the approval, Gindalbie and AnSteel agreed to support development of a new port at Oakajee in western Australia to transport ore to mills in China.
Gindalbie has said it expects to start mining a hematite iron ore, which does not require further processing for steelmaking, in 2009. Production of magnetite iron ore, which requires processing, is slated for 2010.
As part of the transaction, Gindalbie will acquire a 50 percent stake in a iron pellet-making plant in China owned by Anshan. (Reporting by James Regan)
