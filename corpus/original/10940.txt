), BYD's chairman said on Monday, sending shares in his company up 8 percent.

"MidAmerican has always intended to raise its stake in BYD because it believes BYD has good prospects in the development of renewable energy, but we are still considering (whether to sell more)," BYD Chairman Wang Chuanfu told reporters on Monday.
BYD, Hong Kong's largest listed auto stock, also said it expects to sell its e6 electric car in the United States in 2010, a year ahead of schedule.
"BYD shares are not cheap at the current price level, but since the company's strategy is in line with Beijing's policy, and with the support of Buffett, the market is willing to pay a premium for that," said Ben Kwong, the chief operating officer of KGI Asia.
China's government has been encouraging local automakers to focus on more fuel efficient models and environmentally friendly technologies.
BYD shares rose 8 percent to close at HK$48.6 on Monday, more than six times what MidAmerican paid and valuing the company at about $13 billion. The benchmark Hang Seng index

"e6 will be launched in the United States by the end of 2010 and they are now being tested under U.S. regulations," Wang said.
The electric cars will be sold in Shenzhen first in the fourth quarter of 2009 and will gradually expand to other cities in China, he added.

BYD said it now hopes to exceed its 2009 sales target of 400,000 vehicles.
