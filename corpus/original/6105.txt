Should not that story read ¡°CHINA AND GM¡¯s sales up, rather then ¡°GM China sales up¡±? Most ignore the fact that our ¡°free trade partner¡± demands by LAW, ALL foreign business there be owned 50% plus BY CHINA. So China, unlike corrupted USA, gets half of profits, all of technology and ALL taxes. Wonder what would happen if we did such here and they pretty much exclude imports AKA build here or we will ¡°fee¡± (not tariff as that is illegal your: exports to us. AKA Hummer H3 sold USA 30K, at port in China 130K. free trade hardly so.
