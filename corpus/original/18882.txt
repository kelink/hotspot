(Reuters) - The United States promised on Tuesday to take "ambitious actions" to fight global warming as part of a new U.N. climate deal and urged a dramatic increase in aid to help developing nations.
A submission to the United Nations outlining Washington's ideas for a treaty due to be agreed in Copenhagen in December also said that many nations should lay out mid-term greenhouse gas cuts for 2020 and beyond as far as 2050.
"The United States is committed to reaching a strong international agreement in Copenhagen based on both the robust targets and ambitious actions that will be embodied in U.S. domestic law," it said.
China has recently overtaken the United States as the top emitter, ahead of Russia and India. China's per capita emissions, mostly from burning fossil fuels, are less than a quarter of those of each American.
President Barack Obama plans to cut U.S. emissions back to 1990 levels by 2020, a cut of about 14 percent from 2007 emissions. The U.N. Climate Panel says emissions will cause more floods, heatwaves, droughts and rising sea levels. (For Reuters latest environment blogs click on:
