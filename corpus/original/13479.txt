(Reuters) - Chinese number one Li Na has pulled out of a domestic tournament because of the recurrence of an injury that could prevent her from playing at the U.S. Open, local media reported on Thursday.
The 27-year-old felt her right knee injury return after a few matches of the team preliminaries for China's National Games in Shandong, where she was representing her Hubei province.
The world number 18 would have tests in Beijing to determine whether she will be able to play in the North American hardcourt season, including the August 31-September 13 U.S. Open, according to her husband and coach Jiang Shan.
"We have signed up for it and got the visa. If she is okay by then we will go to play," Jiang told the Beijing Youth Daily.
"If not, we would have to go rehabilitation first."
If the injury was serious, they would consider going to Germany for treatment, Jiang added.
Li withdrew from Brisbane, Sydney and the Australian Open at the beginning of this year because of the same problem and again at the Strasbourg and Eastbourne tournaments in May.
The former Wimbledon quarter-finalist, who has suffered from repeated injuries since returning to tennis in 2004 following a 25-month break from the sport, said she wanted to finish at least one season without injury.
"The wish may be too luxurious. It has never come true," she told the paper.
