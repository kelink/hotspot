(Reuters) - Mediatek Inc (
), Taiwan's biggest chip designer and supplier, revised upwards its 2009 cellphone chip shipment target by 20 percent on Tuesday, in yet another sign of a rebound in the tech sector.
The company now expects to ship about 300 million of those chips this year, up from 250 million previously, as demand for feature-jammed smartphones and mobile phones grows in China and other emerging markets.
"Compared to the previous quarter, there is now a recovery in demand for PCs and consumer products, which will help us gain market share in China and other emerging markets," Mediatek President Hsieh Ching-jiang told analysts during a call.
Mediatek earlier reported a market-beating 80 percent rise in its second-quarter net profit to T$9.2 billion ($280 million), and said it expects revenues to climb by about 15 to 20 percent in the current three months from the April-June quarter.
Its sales in the second quarter clocked in at about T$28.15 billion, with a gross profit margin of 59.1 percent, a figure Mediatek expects will remain flat in the current quarter.
Hsieh declined to give specific figures on the company's fourth-quarter outlook, but said revenues should fall slightly as chip shipments typically peak in the third quarter of every year.
) have been experiencing a turnaround in their business, thanks to growing back-to-school demand and consumer expectations that the economy was on a rebound.
Mediatek gave its outlook after the Taiwan stock exchange closed on Tuesday. Its shares have more than doubled this year, compared with a 51 percent advance on the benchmark TAIEX share index
