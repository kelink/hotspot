(Reuters) - Recession-hit Taiwan has begun to depend so heavily on its political rival China, a world economic powerhouse, that the island leadership is seen as beholden to Beijing.
Taiwan has opened up 100 sectors, such as auto parts, textiles and some low-end electronics industries, to Chinese investment. Sensitive foundry and LCD sectors remain off limits.
In April, the two sides announced a framework paving the way for banks, insurers and other financial service providers to invest and do business in each others' markets.
Taiwan's opposition sees the plan as a political sell-out to China and wants a referendum on the issue.
* TRADE, TRANSIT DEALS
Late last year, Taiwan and China signed a landmark deal on daily direct flights, new cargo routes and food safety aimed at increasing trade and tourism between both sides.
The regular flights, which could happen by end-July at the earliest, will replace the current limited charters, easing passage for Taiwanese who do business in China and Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan.
