(Reuters) - U.S. cash crude differentials strengthened Friday as Europe's Brent crude extended its premium to WTI and steepened its contango futures curve.
Heavy Louisiana Sweet HLS- gained 65 cents to trade for as much as $4.10 a barrel above West Texas Intermediate CLc1, while Light Louisiana Sweet LLS- rose 25 cents to trade for +$4.10. Mars sour MRS- gained 10 cents to trade for 40 cents a barrel above WTI.
Front-month Brent crude LCO1 surged against WTI futures, widening its per barrel premium over the U.S. benchmark crude contract to as much as $5.37 during Friday's trading. WTI fell $2.87 a barrel to $67.65 after market settlement, while Brent fell only $1.07 to $72.50.
In Europe, Germany and France emerged from recession after posting a surprise return to economic growth in the second quarter, according to GDP figures released Thursday. [ID:nLD514771]
European growth amid a continuing recession in the U.S. economy bolsters potential demand for Brent, which has also been driven higher by strong Asian consumption and the expectation of upcoming North Sea field maintenance in September, analysts said.
"We're flagging here (in the United States), with the retail sales and consumer sentiment numbers confirming each other, while Europe is seeing some growth," said John Kilduff, senior vice president at MF Global in New York.
Kilduff also noted China's recent crude import binge driving demand for Brent and North Sea maintenance that will cut Brent production.
In U.S. crude futures trade, the contango spread widened to $2.15 a barrel between September and October crude, up from $1.90 a barrel late Thursday.
Other grades traded Friday include Poseidon sour PSD-, which rose 10 cents to 40 cents above WTI.
WTI at Midland WTM- exchanged hands for 20 cents above WTI, up from 5 cents above on Thursday. West Texas Sour WTS- traded for $1.05 below WTI, versus -$1.10 when it traded earlier in the week, on Tuesday. Bonito sour BS- remained even at +$2.20.
