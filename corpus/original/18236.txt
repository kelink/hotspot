Teva eyes expansion in Russia, France, Brazil: executive
Thu  EDT
), the world's largest generic drug maker, is interested in expanding its presence in Russia, France and Brazil, although it is too early to consider a major presence in China, a top company executive said on Thursday.
Acquisitions have fueled Teva's rise in generic drugs, including its recent $7.46 billion deal for U.S. rival Barr Pharmaceuticals.
Asked at an investor conference about any geographic holes the company might want to fill, Teva North America CEO Bill Marth said: "There are some very interesting markets that we know will grow over time."
"We now have a pretty robust business in Russia, but I wouldn't mind some more exposure to Russia," Marth said at the Bank of America conference, which was broadcast over the Internet.
Teva has a good business in most of the European Union, Marth said, but "wouldn't mind strengthening" in France, where he said the company is about the No. 3 player.
Marth also said "Brazil is of interest to us," while adding that it is "not an easy market for us to get into."
Marth said "it's a little early" for Teva to be weighing a "great presence into China."
The Israel-based company also will put emphasis on building out its specialty pharmaceutical franchise, which now includes medicines in neurology, respiratory and women's health, Marth said.
