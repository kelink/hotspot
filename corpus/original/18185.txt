"The long-term deficit and debt that we have accumulated is unsustainable. We can't keep on just borrowing from China or borrowing from other countries," Obama told a town hall meeting event in New Mexico.
"We have to pay interest on that debt and that means that we're mortgaging our children's future with more and more debt," he said.
China is the single largest holder of U.S. debt and owned $744 billion worth of U.S. government securities at the end of February, the latest month for which data is available, according to the U.S. Treasury.
"What's also true is at some point they're just going to get tired of buying our debt," he said.
"And when that happens, we will really have to raise interest rates to be able to borrow and that will raise interest rates for everybody."
