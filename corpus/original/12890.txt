UPDATE 2-Michelin keeps cash goal despite H1 loss

(Reuters) - French tyre manufacturer Michelin (
The group said it was committed to generating positive free cash flow in the second half, after achieving 575 million euros ($811.6 million) in the first six months of the year.
It posted a net attributable loss of 119 million euros in the first half, while the consensus of 11 analysts was for a loss of 255 million, against 430 million last year. Michelin said the loss was due to high restructuring costs.
The group achieved an operating margin of 4 percent in the first half, with an operating income before non-recurring items of 282 million euros against a consensus on a Michelin-conducted poll of 100 million.
Cash flow and a cut in net debt were also "significant positive surprises", driven by a reduction in inventory, said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a research note, adding that "Michelin surprised in all the right areas".
The group said inventory was down by 580 million euros since the end of 2008, when it stood at 3.677 billion euros.
"Second half margin should be closer to 10 percent than 4 percent," Jonas said in the note.
Michelin shares were up 6.9 percent at 0807 GMT, against a DJ Stoxx European Autos Index .SXAP up 1.7 percent.
"Concerning the business environment, inventories have now returned to more normal levels, but not to the extent that we can talk about a real upturn," chief executive Michel Rollier said in a statement, referring to inventories across the industry.
Michelin's own inventory would probably be lower in 2009 as a whole in terms of value, managing partner Jean-Dominique Senard told a news conference.
In February, when the group presented full-year results, Rollier had said tyre markets would begin to firm in the second half as replacement market inventories were replenished and business activity began to recover. [ID:nLD818886]
The group, which has had to cut working hours and production to cope with the sales slump, would maintain its efforts in the months ahead, but "the decline in raw material prices should support second-half margins", Rollier said.
Senard said raw material price declines should have a positive impact of between 500 million and 600 million euros in 2009, after six years of increases.
Michelin, whose competitors include Germany's Continental AG (
) and Japan's Bridgestone Corp (
), said sales were down 13.4 percent at 7.134 billion euros in the first half.
Unit sales fell 23 percent as tyre demand dropped in all markets except China, Michelin said.
And Germany's Continental AG (
) won a vote to repair its finances but looked set to lose its second chief executive in less than a year amid a bitter power struggle with German ball-bearings maker Schaeffler, which owns just under 50 percent of Continental.
