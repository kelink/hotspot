Clarium's Thiel says losses tied to view on economy

(Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Peter Thiel, whose portfolio is deep in the red this year even as most rivals are up, blamed his performance on one big mistake -- focusing too much on economic fundamentals.
"The basic mistake we made this year, which is not unique to ourselves, is that we focused on the real economy while the financial markets have been decoupled," Thiel said at a conference.
Thiel said China's stimulus plan was a big factor for the good economic numbers that have pointed to recovery, but he doubted China's government would keep the spending up, leading to possible fall in markets.
The 41-year old billionaire co-founder of online payment company PayPal, has long held a contrarian view that the economy is not recovering as quickly as this year's sharp financial market rally might suggest.
Clarium Capital, the hedge fund firm Thiel founded seven years ago to make big bets on global market trends, manages roughly $2 billion, down from about $6 billion a year ago. Through the middle of September, Clarium was off roughly 16 percent while the average hedge fund had gained about 14 percent, data from Hedge Fund Research show.
"If you looked at unemployment data, consumer confidence data and the contraction in credit you would be biased in a very bearish direction," Thiel said.
