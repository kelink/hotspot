(Reuters) - China's air force celebrates the 60th anniversary of its founding with aerial displays and parachutists dressed like fairies from a Chinese folk tale, but its ambitions in space worry analysts in Washington.
Following is a brief overview of China's defense forces:
WORLD'S BIGGEST ARMY:
- The People's Liberation Army (PLA) was born out of the Red Army, a 5 million-strong peasant army that swept Communist leader Mao Zedong to power in 1949. Soviet expertise helped organize it into the more cohesive force that fought in the 1950-1953 Korean War alongside North Korea.
- China's official military budget will grow to 480.7 billion yuan ($70.41 billion) in 2009, up 14.9 percent on year, in line with nearly two decades of double-digit budget rises. Many analysts believe real military spending is significantly higher.
- By comparison, President Barack Obama has sought roughly $534 billion for the Pentagon's core budget in fiscal year 2010, not including war funding, a 4 percent rise from 2009.
- China has never renounced the use of force to bring self-ruled and democratic Taiwan, which it considers its sovereign territory, under Beijing's rule.
- China's 2.3 million-strong armed forces are far bigger than the world's second-largest military, that of the United States, whose forces number around 1.5 million.
- China is trying to transform the PLA into a smaller, sleeker modern force capable of short, high-intensity conflicts against high-tech adversaries.
- The PLA Navy has about 290,000 personnel, many on aged vessels. President Hu Jintao has made the navy's modernization his personal project.
- The navy's mandate includes protecting oil supply lanes to the Middle East. Chinese warships also assist in anti-piracy patrols in waters off Somalia.
- China bought the Varyag, a semi-finished Russian aircraft carrier, a few years ago, but it is unclear whether the Varyag will be put into service or used as a training deck and template for a Chinese-made carrier.
- China in recent years has bought eight Russian-made non-nuclear submarines, adding to four bought in the 1990s. It has also built or is planning its own new submarines, including nuclear-powered subs, to replenish its aged fleet of nearly 60.
- China boasts the world's third-largest air force, with about 400,000 personnel and 2,000 combat aircraft.
- An October 1 parade marking the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China featured bombers, unmanned aircraft, reconnaissance and rescue helicopters. Pride of place went to the F-11, a fighter adapted by China from Russian models.
MISSILES, NUCLEAR WEAPONS:
- China's arsenal includes between 100 and 400 nuclear weapons, controlled by the Second Artillery Corps. China has pledged never to be the first to use nuclear weapons.
- Its deterrent force includes intercontinental ballistic missiles, and land- and submarine-based missiles
