(Reuters) - The outbreak of swine flu in Mexico, and signs it is already spreading to other areas, raise the risk that airlines could suffer a drop in traffic comparable to the 2003 SARS crisis, rating agency Standard & Poor's said.
It said in a statement that while governments were better prepared to contain the disease, the possible use of quarantine measures could have a quicker traffic impact than in the past.
This is how traffic responded to SARS, a respiratory disease first reported in China in Nov. 2002 but which did not become an international issue until early 2003, when it spread rapidly.
