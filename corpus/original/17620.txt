INSTANT VIEW: North Korea says conducted nuclear test
2009-05-24 23:37:00.0
(Reuters) - North Korea said it had successfully conducted a nuclear test on Monday, raising the explosive power and level of control of its nuclear device to a new level.
"We have successfully conducted another nuclear test on May 25 as part of the republic's measures to strengthen its nuclear deterrent," the North's official KCNA news agency said.
TIM SAVAGE, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, NAUTILUS INSTITUTE
"It is interesting timing. But that's probably just a coincidence (the death of South Korea's former president). They would've been preparing for this for a while."
"Certainly South Korea doesn't want to see North Korea enhance (nuclear) capability but they have been living with some threats. So there's a tendency not to react as strongly as Japan and/or the United States."
"I think the obvious next step is going back to the (United Nations) Security Council. This time we will likely get a stronger response than (that to the North's) rocket launch since there is no ambiguity ... but whether the council will have any tools to use is another question. Against North Korea, it seems highly unlikely."
XU GUANGYU, RESEARCHER, CHINA ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT
"North Korea's strategic objective hasn't changed. That objective is to win the attention of the Obama administration, to push the North Korea issue up the agenda."
"China's goal is to ensure that the six-party talks process does not fall apart. Stricter sanctions are not going to achieve that objective. So China may have to compromise with the United States in the Security Council, but it won't want to back strong sanctions. They simply won't help solve the problem."
DILIP SHAHANI, CREDIT ANALYST, HSBC, HONG KONG "I don't think it will have a long term impact. It seems like North Korea is attempting to undermine the current administration (in South Korea), which is already feeling some heat from what the press is saying about the former President passing away."
KOH YU-HWAN, PROFESSOR OF NORTH KOREA STUDIES, DONGKUK
"This test, if confirmed, could indicate North Korea's decision to work at securing actual nuclear capabilities."
"North Korea had been expecting the new U.S. administration to mark a shift from the previous administration's stance, but is realizing that there are no changes. It may have decided that a second test was necessary."
"There does not seem to be any specific correlation with the death of former South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun. North Korea seems to be reacting to the U.S. and South Korean administrations' policies."
DAVID MANN, HEAD OF KOREA RESEARCH, FX STRATEGIST, STANDARD
CHARTERED, HONG KONG
"This is another setback but it is not something we feel will have a lasting impact on the market. This may create just a short-term, knee-jerk reaction."
SHUNJI HIRAIWA, SHIZUOKA PREFECTURAL UNIVERSITY, JAPAN
"If North Korea conducted this test, it is in line with their demands that the United Nations (Security Council) withdraw its resolution and apologize, and that the United States engage in direct negotiations."
"But last time they conducted a nuclear test, in 2006, they gave a final warning, and I think it is a bit strange that they didn't do so this time. It seems as if they ought to have sent more of a message first, then watched the U.N. and U.S. reactions and given a final warning."
"The last time the United States changed its stance after North Korea conducted a nuclear test, so the North probably thought that unless they did so again, the United States wouldn't change. But I don't think this time the United States will alter its stance."
DONG YONG-SUENG, SENIOR FELLOW, SAMSUNG ECONOMIC RESEARCH*
"Timing-wise, it seems like the North pushed ahead with its own schedule set before, regardless of what the South is dealing with including death of former President Roh Moo-hyun.
MOON HONG-SIK, PROFESSOR, CHUNG-ANG UNIVERSITY "North Korea's nuclear test, if it is confirmed, is certainly earlier than expected. It reflects North Korea's discontent with the United Nations and the United States, and its firm determination to take up another 'battle' with them."
"I don't think this is connected to the death of former President Roh Moo-hyun. The test had been on the North's schedule and it just stuck to it."
KIM SUNG-HAN, KOREA UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR
"I don't think they planned this to cause great uncertainty in South Korea while it is dealing with the death of a former president, but the test could cause uncertainty about the stability of the Korean peninsula."
