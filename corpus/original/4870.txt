Factbox: Who gains from Chinese inflation?

(Reuters) - With China's inflation running near a two-year high, people are grumbling about fast-rising costs and the government is battling to rein in prices.
While runaway inflation would clearly be bad for the economy, not everyone loses from a moderate pick-up in prices. Here is a list of groups that stand to benefit.
Food prices, which comprise about a third of China's consumer price index, rose 9.6 percent in the year to December, accounting for about three-quarters of the 4.6 percent inflation rate.
While city dwellers bemoan hefty grocery bills, farmers are earning more. Rural incomes rose faster than urban incomes in 2010 for the first time in 27 years.
Off-farm earnings were a big part of that, but rising food costs were also a boon, especially for those farmers raising the vegetable crops whose prices have risen most steeply.
For the government, higher food prices support its goal of narrowing rural-urban income gaps. This helps explain why Beijing hasn't placed price caps on food items. Instead, it has focused on giving subsidies to hard-hit urban consumers.
One major structural reason for Chinese inflation is a shrinking supply of young workers. This is forcing companies to pay higher wages, especially in labor-intensive industries.
But in the export hub of Guangdong, a province in the south, minimum wages rose 21 percent last year and should go up a further 19 percent this year. Inflation may cut workers' real spending power, but leaves them better off overall.
The massive spending program that brought China's economy roaring back to life after the financial crisis has left behind big debts, especially at the provincial and city level.
Local governments are estimated to have debts equivalent to about 20 percent of gross domestic product and economists worry that many will default, saddling banks with non-performing loans.
At the margins, however, moderate inflation will make it easier for local governments to pay back what they owe as their debt loads shrink in real terms.
Since lifting the yuan from a dollar peg last June, Beijing has let it rise less than 4 percent. But the yuan's real appreciation, accounting for the effect of inflation, was about 4 percentage points higher over that time.
Although this may push up import costs in countries used to cheap Chinese goods, it will also help address the imbalances that plague the global economy by slowly chipping away at China's whopping trade surplus.
Nevertheless, real appreciation is still a distant second-best alternative to nominal appreciation, because heavy inflation exacts a heavy toll on an economy.
CHINA'S ECONOMIC RESTRUCTURING
The World Bank has long argued that China needs to increase prices for utilities, especially energy and water, to ensure that companies consider actual costs when making their investment decisions. If inflation drives these input prices up, that would go a little way toward redressing the misallocation of resources in China's headlong rush toward growth.
