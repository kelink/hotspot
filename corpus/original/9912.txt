"The housing market in the U.S. has stabilized, we've seen stabilization of economic activity in Europe and stronger growth in Asian emerging markets. These are all positive factors which eventually lead to rising demand."
Copper has roughly doubled in price this year, mostly due to Chinese import buying, increased fund flows and economic data across the globe signaling recovery from recession.
More recently, markets have started to fret that the Chinese restocking trend has come to an end, but on Wednesday data from China showed a surprise 23 percent rise in September copper imports. [ID:nSP540802]
