(Reuters) - China's economy has seen signs of improvement but still faces considerable downward pressure, the People's Bank of China said on Wednesday.
The central bank said in a report on region-by-region financial conditions that the global economic crisis was still spreading and that China's recovery to date was not yet on solid ground.
It sounded an optimistic note about China's longer-term development, saying that growth was spreading more strongly to less-developed inland provinces, a process that could become a driving force for the economy in coming years.
In the short term, though, the export outlook remained bleak and local governments needed to adjust their policies to provide more support for exporters, the central bank said.
"Although our economy is showing some positive signs, the foundation is still not solid and downward pressure on the economy remains quite strong," the central bank said.
It appealed to local governments throughout China to implement Beijing's crisis-fighting strategy of stimulating domestic demand, stabilising external demand and promoting "stable and quite fast" economic growth.
Turning to how different regions should position themselves, the central bank said that the east coast, the wealthiest part of China, should try to expand links with international markets while also developing its service, high-tech and advanced manufacturing sectors.
It said that China's poorer central and western regions should focus on improving their basic infrastructure and reducing bottlenecks.
"Our country's interregional economic development is becoming better balanced, more complementary and more sustainable," the report said. "Regional economic development will become a new bright spot of economic growth." (Reporting by Simon Rabinovitch and Aileen Wang; Editing by Alan Wheatley)
