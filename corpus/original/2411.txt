Earlier this week, the ITC rejected duties on refrigerators from South Korea and Mexico and steel wheels from China.
The decision on the steel nails is a victory for Mid Continent Nail Corp, a Missouri-based firm that says it is the largest supplier of fasteners to the wooden pallet and crating industry in the United States.
Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department set anti-dumping duties ranging from 2.8 percent to nearly 185 percent on steel nail imports from the UAE. With the ITC vote, those will now soon go into force.
The U.S. imported about $120 million worth of nails from the UAE in 2011, up from $50.1 million two years earlier.
Clariant Corp, based in North Carolina, brought the case against imports of brightening agents from China and Taiwan.
