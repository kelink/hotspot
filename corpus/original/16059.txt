(Reuters) - The dollar rose broadly on Monday as investors took profits on other major currencies which had climbed to multi-months highs on hopes for a recovery in the global economy.
Some traders said a cautious tone from policy makers who gathered at a Group of Eight finance ministers meeting on the weekend helped temper recent optimism about the economy, encouraging bets in riskier assets to be cut further.
Commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar were under additional pressure after oil prices fell in Asian trade, extending their slide from more than seven-month highs above $73 struck last week.
"The market began taking profits on gains in emerging market currencies as well as higher-yielding currencies before the G8 meeting, and this is continuing as many investors still have their doubts about the recent excessive optimism over an economic recovery," said a senior trader at a Japanese bank.
