(Reuters) - In an announcement that sent its stock to a year-high, coal miner Peabody Energy Corp (
Even though its third-quarter profit dropped sharply, the results beat Wall Street estimates and the company said it was raising 2009 financial targets as coal prices steadily rise.
"We are seeing early signs of a strong return to pre-recession levels," Chief Executive Officer Greg Boyce told Wall Street analysts on a conference call.
"Global economies are improving and in India and China there is robust demand for steel," he said in discussing third-quarter profits.
The earnings, while lower, still easily beat estimates and the company's stock rose 5 percent over the 52-week high of $43.55. In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the stock dropped back to $43.48.
Peabody, which operates mines in the United States and Australia, said Pacific markets continue to strengthen, led by China's and India's demand for metallurgical, or coking coal, for steelmaking. It said that demand has driven up spot prices above the April 1 benchmarks.
"The forward curves also suggest strong price appreciation over the next several years," the company said, adding it would double exports from Australia in the next five years.
Boyce said there would be an increase of 15 percent next year and that by 2013, Peabody could be exporting 35 million to 40 million tons from Australia.
In its earnings release, the St. Louis-based company said net income fell to $106.8 million, or 40 cents per share, from $369.5 million, or $1.35 per share, a year earlier. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $135.5 million, or 49 cents per share.
Revenue fell to $1.67 billion from $1.89 billion a year earlier, said the company, whose thermal, or steam, coal fuels about 10 percent of America's electricity generation.
Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 22 cents per share and revenue of $1.42 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
"They were strong across the board, Peabody is setting the bar pretty high for everyone else," said Jeremy Sussman, an analyst with Brean Murray Carret & Co.
"There was something for everyone -- they had record met (metallurgical coal) shipments in Australia and volumes were stronger than expected. And surprisingly, U.S. numbers looked good, they brought down costs through disciplined management."
Peabody said U.S. revenues per ton increased 11 percent over the 2008 third quarter due to higher realized prices. Realized revenues for Australia averaged $82 per ton -- $125 per ton for metallurgical coal and $72 per ton for thermal, or steam coal, which is used for power generation. That was 33 percent higher than the second quarter, it said.
Total sales volumes totaled 63.5 million tons, down from 65.6 million tons a year earlier. But Australian sales of 6.5 million tons were 30 percent above the second quarter and Australian metallurgical coal exports were 2.7 million tons, nearly triple the pace of the first half of 2009.
Peabody raised its 2009 target for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. In the second quarter, it had forecast $1 billion to $1.2 billion.
Earnings per share from continuing operations is targeted at $1.34 to $1.54 including a tax remeasurement, or $1.60 to $1.80 excluding the tax effects. Analysts currently expect $1.47 for the year.
The company is targeting 2009 sales of approximately 190 million tons in the United States and 21 to 23 million tons in Australia. Total company sales are expected to be 235 million to 245 million tons. Peabody's earlier 2009 production estimates were for 185 million to 190 million tons in the United States and 20 million to 23 million tons in Australia.
