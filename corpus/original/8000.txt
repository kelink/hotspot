(Reuters) - Canada's Grande Cache Coal Corp's GCE.TO quarterly profit dropped about 80 percent, hurt by weaker coal prices that tumbled from year-ago high levels, but topped estimates on lower costs.
For the second quarter ended Sept. 30, the company earned C$9.3 million, or 9 Canadian cents a share, down from C$47.1 million, or 51 Canadian cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue fell to C$44.8 million, as the company sold coal at an average sales price of C$124 a tonne, down from C$223 a tonne, year ago.
The company was expected to report earnings of 2 Canadian cents a share, on a revenue of C$44.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Cost of sales during the quarter was C$84 per tonne, down 19 percent, largely due to a decrease in costs relating to contractor services, maintenance and diesel fuel, the company said.
The increase is due to a continuing recovery in demand from traditional customers and sales to new customers in China, the company said. Shares of the Calgary, Alberta-based company closed at C$3.85 Monday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Ashutosh Joshi in Bangalore; Editing by Aradhana Aravindan)
