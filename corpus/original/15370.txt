(Reuters) - China Minsheng Banking Corp (
), China's first listed non-state lender, has hired four banks to handle its 20 billion yuan ($2.93 billion) Hong Kong share offering.
The banks involved in the offering are Bank of China International Ltd, China International Capital Corp, Macquarie Group and UBS AG, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter.
A Minsheng spokesman in Beijing declined to comment on the report. Macquarie declined to comment. BOCI, CICC and UBS could not be immediately reached for comments.
If Minsheng successfully sells 20 billion shares in Hong Kong, the bank's price-to-book ratio would be around 2 times, according to a Everbright Securities research note dated June 6.
"In that case, the price is not expensive," said Sheng Nan, an analyst with UBO Kay Hian in Shanghai. "The market should have an interest in it."
Shareholders of Minsheng earlier this week approved the bank's plan for a Hong Kong share offering, and the bank is expected to complete a share offering in Hong Kong by the end of this year. [ID:nPEK103981]
The Shanghai-listed lender expects to issue up to 15 percent of its expanded capital, or up to 3.32 billion shares. There will be a greenshoe option to increase the issue by an additional 15 percent.
By 0537 GMT, Minsheng Bank's shares traded up 1.13 percent to 8.03 yuan in Shanghai, beating a 0.35 percent increase of the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index
