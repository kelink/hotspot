Big currency swings undesirable: China c.banker

(Reuters) - It is beneficial for major currencies, including China's, to have some flexibility, but big swings in value would be harmful to the economy, a deputy Chinese central bank governor said on Saturday.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) in mid-June ended the yuan's 23-month de facto peg to the dollar, vowing to implement greater flexibility but also to keep the currency basically stable. The yuan has since risen 0.8 percent against the dollar. <CNY/>
Two weeks after the central bank unveiled greater currency flexibility, Hu Xiaolian, one of its vice governors, stressed the importance of avoiding excessive volatility.
"Speculative and flock-driven fluctuations are a big blow to confidence, and are harmful to the real economy," Hu told a forum in Shanghai.
The yuan's stability during the financial crisis, after Beijing in mid-2008 halted three years of steady appreciation, played an important role in strengthening confidence in global markets, she said.
Hu noted that China's current account surplus had been shrinking as a share of gross domestic product, and said such movements were indications of the underlying fundamentals of a currency's value, hinting that pressure for it to appreciate might be easing somewhat.
She also suggested more attention should be paid to the yuan's movements against multiple currencies than to its moves against a single currency.
While the yuan has held steady against the dollar over the past months, it has appreciated against other currencies including the euro as the dollar has strengthened in global markets.
"Observations on the valuation of a currency should not only be based on bilateral exchanges rates, but rather should be based on more comprehensive, and effective exchange rates," she said.
