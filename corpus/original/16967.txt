(Reuters) - Japan's trade minister has expressed caution about setting an aggressive target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, saying he was worried about the ability of households and businesses to cope, a newspaper reported on Wednesday.
A government advisory panel has proposed six target options, one of which is to cut emissions by 15 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels. Japan's environment minister has also said achieving that goal was possible.
"Politicians need to think about its feasibility and how much of a burden households can take on," Trade Minister Toshihiro Nikai was quoted by the Asahi newspaper as saying in an interview.
Prime Minister Taro Aso is expected to finalise Japan's target on midterm emissions cuts by mid-June, ahead of a U.N. conference in December that is meant to forge a new treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol.
Japan, the world's fifth-biggest emitter, is keen to carve out a role for itself as a leader on environmental issues, but the business community is nervous about setting stringent targets before signs that growing economies such as China and India are ready to agree to emissions cuts.
Many Japanese companies are also reluctant to go beyond their current energy conservation efforts while the world's second-largest economy struggles with its deepest recession on record. (Reporting by Yoko Nishikawa; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)
