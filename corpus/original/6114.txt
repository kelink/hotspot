Mobius also said in a news briefing that China's economy was still booming and consumption in the world's third largest economy would continue to rise at a fast pace.
"Our projection for growth in China is about 10 percent. Sure, it could come down, but 9 percent is still terrific, and even 8 percent is still good," Mobius said.
The sharp drop in Chinese stocks this year reflected worries over the momentum of the economy, he said, but was also the result of the country's massive IPO pipeline.
"There has been too many new shares coming in the market, too much money being drained out," he said.
Mobius was also bullish on Russian stocks, citing the country's growth outlook and stocks' relatively low price-to-earnings ratios.
"We saw Russian stocks at very reasonable levels, and have found good opportunities. Actually, we have been doing more in Russia than anywhere else lately," he said.
