Analysts said the Kindle's U.S. price cut and expansion overseas should boost revenue from the device and digital book sales and help Amazon hold its lead in the electronic reader market.
"Amazon has first mover advantage in the United States and they'd like to enjoy that abroad as well," said digital media analyst Loren Johnson at market research consultancy Frost & Sullivan.
The company will also cut the price of its U.S. Kindle by $40 to $259, as volume increases have offset manufacturing costs. Only a year ago, the device cost $359.
"Amazon is seeing this as a much more competitive space," said Johnson, adding that the company's massive reader base still gives it a prime advantage that will secure its market leader position "for a long time."
The price cut, argued analyst Mark Mahaney, comes earlier than expected and comes before Amazon has a true competitor.
"This price cut increases the chance that the Kindle becomes one of the hit products this holiday season," wrote Mahaney in a note.
JPMorgan said the international launch could significantly boost the company's profit, which JPMorgan estimates will be $2.07 per share in 2010.
"Even at 6 million devices, EPS impact is huge," wrote analyst Imran Khan. "We estimate that 6 million Kindle users, buying one book and a subscription a month, could drive approximately $0.40 in annual EPS impact for Amazon."
Shares of Amazon rose 3.2 percent, or $2.95, to $93.86 in early afternoon trade on the Nasdaq after rising as high as 3.9 percent. Shares are up 73 percent since the start of the year, as of Tuesday's closing price. (Reporting by Alexandria Sage; Editing by Derek Caney)
