(Reuters) - U.S. network equipment maker 3Com Corp COMS.O posted a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, but forecast first-quarter results below Wall Street expectations, sending its shares down as much as 14 percent.
"We expect to see a decline in our first-quarter cash balance due to an anticipated $50 million payment in China for long term incentive employee payments," Chief Financial Officer Jay Zager said on a conference call with analysts.
The company forecast first-quarter earnings of 3 cents to 5 cents a share, excluding items, on revenue of $270 million to $280 million. Analysts were looking for earnings of 7 cents a share, excluding items, on revenue of $301.0 million.
3Com reported fourth-quarter net income of $20.2 million, or 5 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $166.7 million, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding a $158.0 million goodwill impairment charge, its profit was 10 cents a share. Revenue fell 8.2 percent to $295.1 million.
Analysts expected earnings of 5 cents a share, excluding exceptional items, on revenue of $294.8 million, according to Reuters Estimates.
Shares of the company were trading down 11 percent at $4.20 Thursday afternoon on Nasdaq. They touched a low of $4.05 earlier in the day. (Reporting by Shrutika Verma in Bangalore; Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)
