(Reuters) - Coca-Cola (
) to weigh partnership options after China blocked its takeover of the company last month, a source familiar with the situation said.
In March, China rejected Coca-Cola's planned $2.4 billion acquisition of top juice maker Huiyuan, saying the deal would have been bad for competition. The acquisition would have been the largest-ever buyout of a Chinese company by a foreign rival.
"After the deal collapsed there have been discussions in Beijing," the source said, adding that the talks with senior Huiyuan management are at an informal stage.
Coca-Cola is in negotiations with Huiyuan that could include taking a minority stake in the Chinese juice maker's assets, a Wall Street Journal report citing unidentified sources said on Thursday.
China's Ministry of Commerce rejected the takeover deal under an anti-monopoly law enacted last year, saying in a statement that Coca-Cola's changes to the deal were insufficient to allay its concerns.
At the time of the decision, Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Dallas-based Hodges Capital Management, called the rejection "a minor setback" for Coca-Cola rather than "a major slap in the face".
"They'll probably regroup and try to go at it from a different angle," Bradshaw said.
"It is our policy not to comment on speculation," Kenth Kaerhoeg, a Coca-Cola spokesman in Hong Kong said. (Reporting by Joseph Chaney; editing by Mike Nesbit)
