(Reuters) - Brazil's pork industry has asked the World Health Organization (WHO) to stop referring to the deadly flu outbreak from Mexico as "swine flu" as the name is damaging the pork industry without any scientific grounds.
Pedro de Camargo Neto, chairman of the Brazilian Industry Association of Pork Meat Production and Exports, adopted the term "Mexican flu" and wrote to the WHO's director general, Margaret Chan, asking her to put an end to the misnomer.
"Swine are not infected and are not the vector of the disease. There is not one pig identified in Mexico (as infected with the strain)," he told Reuters.

JBS, which controls pork production units in various countries including North America, said in statement earlier on Tuesday that it did not expect the swine flu in North America to affect its growth in revenues as pork exports are only a small part of its largely beef-dominated operations.
"The misinformation comes from the name. That is why we call it Mexican flu," he said, adding the issue distracted people from focusing on the person-to-person infection through which it has spread.
It also suggested "hybrid influenza" as an alternative. (Reporting by Peter Murphy; editing by Reese Ewing)
