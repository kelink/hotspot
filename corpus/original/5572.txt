Factbox: How rare earths are used in various industries

(Reuters) - Rare earths have stormed to the forefront of global worries over fears that China's policy of curbing exports will increasingly cause shortages in other industrialized economies, given its status as the dominant global supplier.
Despite their name, rare earth elements are a relatively abundant group of 17 chemical elements. They were originally described as rare because they were unknown in their elemental form and difficult to extract from the rocks that contained them.
Glass - Cerium is the major constituent of this sector, where it is used in ultra-violet light filtering.
Polishing - A rapidly growing sector that is based on the unique chemical and mechanical properties of cerium in the polishing of glass, including multi-level electronic components. Metal Alloys - Nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries are the key driver of demand and could put pressure on lanthanum supply.
Magnets - Currently, the most dynamic market for rare earths with growth in demand increasing at 15 percent a year for the past 10 years, causing neodymium and terbium to increase by more than 40 percent over the past 12 months
Neodymium laser range-finders, guidance systems, communications
Every hybrid-electric and electric vehicle has a large battery. Each battery is made using several pounds of rare earth compounds. The use of electric vehicles is expected to increase rapidly, driven by energy independence, climate change and other concerns. This is a key growth area for rare earths.
