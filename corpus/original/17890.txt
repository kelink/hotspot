FACTBOX-Mauritius' economy suffering in global slowdown
Wed  EDT
* For a nation of 1.3 million people far from its markets, Mauritius packs an economic punch well above its weight. However, the economic downturn in its core European and Asian markets and depressed demand at home have slowed the roughly $9 billion economy.
* Once reliant on sugar and textiles, the Indian Ocean island has diversified into tourism, banking, IT and business outsourcing. In doing so it has become one of Africa's most stable and prosperous economies. This year the IMF forecasts the average Mauritian will have an income of $7,100.
* During the first quarter of 2009, arrivals fell 9.9 percent to 235,715 from the previous year.
* Mauritius' textile sector predicted a tough 2009 at the turn of the year. Local factories supply leading European high street chains including Marks & Spencers and Zara, as well as luxury outlets like Britain's Saville Row.
* Indications are that the 15 percent demand drop expected by some in 2009 was too high. However, orders are at short notice and the sector is haemorrhaging more jobs than other sectors.
* The island's luxury property boom is over for now. Orders have ground to a halt slashing foreign direct investment.
* Britain and France are Mauritius' two main export markets, accounting for 34 percent and 13.4 percent of exports. Last year saw a 1.9 percent fall in exports to 68.41 billion rupees ($2.08 billion) compared to 2007.
* India and China account for 23.9 percent and 11.5 percent of imports respectively. In 2008, imports were up 9.5 percent on the previous year at 132.56 billion rupees.
* Key advantages for foreign investors are Mauritius' political stability and rule of law, fluency in English and French, a time zone that allows daytime dialogue with the Far East, Europe and America. Last year the World Bank listed Mauritius in the Top 25 best places to do business.
* Main disadvantages are the island's distance from major markets and its own small market size.
* Finance Minister Ramakrishna Sithanen has said it will balance fiscal stimulus with controlled spending to keep the budget deficit in check. Sithanen has said the deficit could hit 7 percent by the end of 2009 if measures are not taken. Anything above 5.5 percent would be unsustainable, he said.
* The budget will build upon last December's $310 million stimulus package. The private sector has called for its scope to be broadened and the disbursement of funds accelerated.
* Sithanen has run the budget since 2006 and overseen a period of sustained growth, falling unemployment, rising foreign investment and economic diversification. (Editing by David Clarke/Victoria Main)
