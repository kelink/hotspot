(Reuters) - China plans to implement a five year program advocating clean online games, starting next year, an official from the General Administration of Press and Publication told an industry conference on Wednesday.
Earlier this week, GAPP issued a notice warning against the illegal release of online games and declaring stricter control over the approval process.
The "China Green Online Games Publishing Program" will be launched this year and the implementation begun next year, the Xinhua news agency said, citing remarks by Sun Shoushan, vice director of the GAPP, at an industry conference in Shanghai.
"Some companies provide unhealthy and persuasive contents in online games for players, especially the young ones, so as to attract players and make unlawful profits," Sun was quoted as saying.
The online game industry in China is expected to grow by between 30 percent and 50 percent this year, with a sales revenue of 24 billion to 27 billion yuan ($3.51 billion-$3.95 billion), according to the official.
