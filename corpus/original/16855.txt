(Reuters) - The United States, in rare harsh criticism of China's human rights record, demanded Beijing account for those killed and missing in the Tiananmen Square protests it crushed two decades ago.
"A China that has made enormous progress economically and is emerging to take its rightful place in global leadership should examine openly the darker events of its past and provide a public accounting of those killed, detained or missing, both to learn and to heal," U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement.
"This anniversary provides an opportunity for Chinese authorities to release from prison all those still serving sentences in connection with the events surrounding June 4, 1989," she added in the statement read by State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley.
Chinese security forces blanketed Tiananmen Square before the 20th anniversary of the June 4 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, and a day after Twitter and other Internet services in China were blocked.
Black police vans lurked at the side of the Forbidden City, near the square, while police and paramilitary forces patrolled through crowds of tourists.
Crowley said China had made some progress on human rights in the two decades since the Tiananmen protests were crushed, citing efforts by local authorities to crack down on corruption and to protect property rights.
Asked if the heavy police presence around Tiananmen Square constituted progress, Crowley replied: "No. It is not."
"We would prefer to see a China that's prepared to learn from history rather than trying to hide it," he added. "This is inconsistent with the actions of a great power." (Reporting by Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Doina Chiacu)
