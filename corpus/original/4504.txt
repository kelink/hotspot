Factbox: China's fledgling shale gas sector

(Reuters) - Encouraged by the boom in shale natural gas drilling in the United States, and driven by domestic gas shortages, China has fast-tracked plans to explore the unconventional fuel, part of a massive push to boost gas consumption and cut down heavy dependence on dirtier coal.
Experts say China's technically recoverable shale gas resources are, by far, the world's biggest.
China's CNOOC LTD has concluded two gas deals with U.S. shale gas explorer Chesapeake Energy, a move that may allow it to acquire and develop the technology to extract gas from shale rock.
China's Ministry of Land & Resources (MLR) will soon hold its first auction of eight shale gas blocks. The auction is only open to domestic energy firms, including CNOOC, Sinochem, Xinjiang Guanghui, Zhenhua, PetroChina, Sinopec, and Shaanxi Yanchang.
Here are some key facts about China's shale gas sector, culled from company announcements and state media reports.
The land ministry, in charge of resource registrations and management of mining rights, is target ting 50-80 shale gas prospects and 20-30 exploration and development blocks by 2020.
A research arm of the ministry also aims to locate one trillion cubic meters of recoverable shale gas reserves, build 15-30 billion cubic meters of production capacity and produce 8-12 percent of China's natural gas from shale by 2020.
PetroChina and Sinopec, however, have set their own goals, which are more modest.
China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), which runs most gas and oil businesses through its listed arm, PetroChina, aims to produce 500 million cubic meters (mcm) of shale gas by 2015, a deputy general manager said in July.
A U.S. Energy Information Administration report this month, however, said China had 1,275 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable shale gas resources -- by far the largest in the world, followed by the United States with 862 trillion cubic feet and Argentina with 774.
China's Sichuan basin, Erdos basin, Bohai Bay, Songliao basin, Jianghan basin, Tuha basin, Tarim basin and Junggar basin, mostly in the west and north, may hold shale gas.
The upstream regions of the Yangtze River valley, which include the southern and eastern parts of Sichuan province, southeastern parts of Chongqing, northern parts of Guizhou and western parts of Hubei, are likely to contain sizeable deposits, according to preliminary estimates by the land ministry.
* April 2011, China's MLR is expected to hold the first auction of shale gas blocks for exploration and development, with eight on offer.
* March 2011, PetroChina completes first horizontal shale gas well in the Weiyuan block of Sichuan province.

* December 2010, Sinopec strikes shale gas flows in two exploration wells in central and southwestern China.
* August 2010, ConocoPhillips is reported to be in advanced talks with PetroChina over development of a 3,000-sq kms shale gas block between Chengdu, capital of southwestern Sichuan province, and Chongqing municipality.
* June 2010, Sinopec sets up shale gas exploration arm that eyes exploration breakthrough in 2-3 years and start industrial-level development of the gas in 3-5 years.
* May 2010, government officials say Beijing will likely offer subsidies and tax incentives to shale gas production, similar to that for coal seam gas, whose production enjoys up to 0.33 yuan ($0.0485) per cubic meters of financial aid. approval.
* May 2010, Sinopec says shale fracturing at its Fangshen 1 well in Guizhou province is a success, the first such operation in China.
* May 2010, China and the United States announce they will cooperate in areas including shale gas, smart grid, clean coal, renewable energy, nuclear power and electric cars.
* January 2010, Sinopec is reported to be in talks with BP over potential cooperation in exploring and developing a 2,000-sq-km shale gas block in Kaili in Guizhou province and a 1,000-sq km block in Huangqiao in Jiangsu province.
* November 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao sign cooperation pack to develop China's shale gas resources.
* November 2009, an MLR unit drills test well in southwestern Chongqing and confirms shale gas deposits.
* November 2009, PetroChina and Royal Dutch Shell agree to jointly evaluate shale gas reserves of the Fushun-Yongchuan block in Sichuan basin.
* October 2007, Houston-based Newfield Exploration Co agrees to jointly study with PetroChina shale gas resources at the Weiyuan field in the Sichuan basin in southwestern China. (Reporting by Jim Bai and Chen Aizhu; Editing by Bill Tarrant)
