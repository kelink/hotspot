After 10 races in a row without a McLaren driver on the podium, the 24-year-old Briton stormed to the checkered flag at the Hungarian Grand Prix to put a smile on the face of long-suffering team boss Martin Whitmarsh.
"It's an incredible feeling to be back here after what feels such a long time away and with such a struggle with me and my team," said Hamilton.
"I am just so proud of the guys, as I go into the factory and I see how hard everyone is pushing. Everyone wants to win just as much as I do and they never gave up," he added after more than doubling his points tally for the season in a single race.
"They have never given up which is something very rare to see in such a large group of people. I am very, very proud of them.
"Undoubtedly we have caught up quite a bit but we never felt we had the pace to win. But the car felt fantastic and it is incredibly special to get back up here, not only on the podium, but to get a win. It is amazing."
Since then, they have thrown everything at catching up with pacesetters Brawn GP and Red Bull.
It is also a track that has smiled on McLaren in the past, with the team winning there in 2007 and 2008 and now four times in the last five years.
"We need to take as much as we can from this weekend and continue to push," said Hamilton, whose last win was in China in October last year.
"We have got some improvements to make for sure and some work to do to be able to beat these guys on a more regular basis. But this is one huge leap for us and hopefully we are now on the right track, so let's keep going."
"Even as recently as four weeks ago, I don't think many people would have believed you if you'd told them that we'd win the Hungarian Grand Prix in dominant fashion, but that's exactly what we did today," he said.
