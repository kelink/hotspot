UPDATE 2-FLSmidth to cut more jobs after Q1 orders dive
2009-05-28 11:24:00.0
(Reuters) - Engineering group FLSmidth & Co A/S (
The Danish maker of equipment for the cement and minerals industries said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell 3 percent year-on-year to 578 million crowns ($108 million) versus a mean forecast of 534 million in a Reuters poll.
Order intake slumped 66 percent to 3.11 billion crowns, although activity in March was higher than January and February.
"Based on the current market situation it is considered necessary to make an additional staff reduction of around 700 employees," the company said.
Chief Executive Officer Jorgen Huno Rasmussen told Reuters the new cuts -- 6 percent of the workforce of 11,352 at the end of the quarter -- would be made in units globally.
The firm, which had in January announced plans to cut 600 staff, gave no further details.
Rasmussen said some rivals seemed to have been hit even harder than FLSmidth by the crisis. "We have a hunch we are actually taking market share, particularly in minerals," he said.
Cement makers were being hit by overcapacity and falling demand, as well as tighter access to financing, FLSmidth said.
The company said, however, it had seen no further cancellations of orders in the quarter and expected the number of cancelled orders and orders on hold to have peaked.
Sydbank analyst Jacob Pedersen said while the lack of cancellations in the quarter was a positive sign, it shouldn't be confused with an upturn: "They won't (improve) for the next couple of quarters."
FLSMidth forecast full-year sales between 20 billion crowns and 23 billion, compared with a previous forecast for between 20 billion and 25 billion.
The company, which supplies cement makers such as Lafarge (
), HeidelbergCement (
), said it still saw the global market for new contracted cement kiln capacity excluding China falling to between 25 million tonnes and 50 million this year from 123 million in 2008.
FLSmidth had a 32 percent share of that market in 2008, up 3 percentage points from 2007.
Shares in FLSmidth were down 4.5 percent to 196.75 crowns at 1515 GMT, underperforming the wider market in Copenhagen
but still well above a year's low of 114.00 crowns set in early March.
The company cancelled dividend payments in 2008 to save funds for acquisitions and said it was using the global economic gloom to examine acquisition candidates. (Writing by Anna Ringstrom; Editing by Hans Peters and David Holmes) ($1=5.364 Danish Crown)
