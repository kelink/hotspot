No need for big changes to Iran deal: Solana

(Reuters) - European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana said on Tuesday he saw no need for fundamental changes to a U.N.-drafted nuclear fuel deal with Iran, despite suggestions Tehran wants changes.
Iran's Arabic-language al Alam state television channel cited an unnamed official as saying Tehran would present its response to the proposed agreement within 48 hours, but would also demand some "important changes."
"The deal was a good deal," Solana, who was headed Western negotiating efforts with Tehran, told a news conference after EU foreign ministers met in Luxembourg. "I don't think in principle it requires fundamental changes."
"It's not a good sign...it is a bad indication," he told reporters in Luxembourg.
"Time is running out for the Iranians... This region is inflammable. It's an explosive circle and I do not think that in such a context the Iranians can play for time. That is very dangerous," he said.
The deal reached on October 1 between Iran and six world powers -- the United States, Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain -- would involve Iran sending potential nuclear fuel abroad for processing to allay Western concerns that it is trying to develop nuclear weapons.
Diplomats said EU ministers had already asked the EU executive to look into additional sanctions that could be imposed on Iran after discussing the country's nuclear issue at a meeting on Monday evening.
