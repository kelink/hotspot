Wall Street stocks rose up to 0.6 percent on Friday, as confidence in the economic recovery was lifted by reports showing U.S. consumers in good heart.
British and European shares gained at least 0.3 percent, with strong Chinese growth data lifting miners, which along with the U.S. data, helped overcome weakness in banking and energy companies.
Japan's Nikkei average
is set to open higher, with Nikkei futures traded in Chicago closing 55 points higher than the Osaka close, with exporters likely to be helped by a weaker yen.
Australian shares are also poised for a positive start, with stock index futures at 4,656, a 21-point premium over the underlying index's .AXJO close on Friday.
Nikkei futures in Chicago 10,155
Nikkei futures in Osaka 10,100
