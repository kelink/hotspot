(Reuters) - Oil prices rallied for a fifth day on Wednesday to top $75 a barrel for the first time this year, stoked by a weak dollar and surprisingly strong China trade data that underscored a recovery in the world's No. 2 oil consumer.
Markets have been steadily rising after a dramatic collapse to near $30 a barrel in December and January, from a record peak of almost $150 in July last year.
January 2, 2008: U.S. crude briefly breaks the $100 barrier for the first time on the first trading day of 2008. Prices rise fairly steadily through the first half of the year.
March 5: Despite new record price highs of over $104 a barrel, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which pumps more than a third of the world's oil, says it will not put more oil on the market. It says there is enough oil, and blames U.S. economic "mismanagement" for global prices.
July 15: A sell-off begins after remarks by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke indicating a significant fall in demand in the United States, the world's top consumer.
Aug 15: Prices continue sharp decline, falling to around $110 a barrel for Brent crude.
Sept 15: Prices below $100 a barrel for first time since March 4, and still falling.
Sept 22: Oil spikes $16 in biggest one-day gain on record. Prices pop over $120 a barrel, extending a climb from a low near $90 the previous week after the United States unveils a sweeping rescue plan for its battered financial sector.
But soon after, oil prices begin a heavy slide.

Aug 25: U.S. crude rises to touch this year's resistance level of $75 a barrel, the first time since late-Oct 2008.
Sept 10: At its meeting, OPEC kept output targets steady at the reduced levels agreed in September 2008, as high oil prices of above $71 meant there was no need for action.
Oct 14: U.S. crude rises to $75.15 a barrel, the highest in 2009, underscored by a soft dollar and optimism over a global economic recovery.
