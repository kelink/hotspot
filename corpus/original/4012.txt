(Reuters) - China's Foreign Ministry warned U.S. officials on Thursday not to meet with visiting exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, saying it hoped Washington "appropriately dealt" with Tibet-related issues.
China reviles the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Dalai Lama, saying he supports the use of violence to establish an independent Tibet. He strongly denies either accusation, insisting he seeks only true autonomy for the remote region.
The U.S. State Department said he met on Wednesday with Under Secretary of State for Democracy and Global Affairs Maria Otero, but that it remained to be decided whether he would have any meetings at higher levels.
On Thursday, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and other senior U.S. lawmakers also met the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Beijing's position on the Dalai Lama's foreign visits was clear.
"We oppose the underhand visits of the Dalai Lama which he uses to engage in activities to split the motherland," Hong told a regular news briefing.
"At the same time, we also oppose any foreign government or politicians supporting or abetting in such activities by the Dalai Lama," he added.
"We hope that the United States strictly abide by its promises on the Tibet issue and ... cautiously and appropriately deal with relevant issues," Hong said.
The Dalai Lama met U.S. President Barack Obama last year, drawing strong denunciation from Beijing.
Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, issued a statement saying Obama should also meet the Dalai Lama to make it "clear that the U.S. sides with the victims in Tibet, not the perpetrators in Beijing."
"President Obama has an opportunity to make a strong statement about what we stand for by meeting with the Dalai Lama during his current visit, and I urge him to take it," said Ros-Lehtinen, a staunch critic of Communist governments.
State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said China had complained about the Dalai Lama's meeting with Otero, who is the State Department's coordinator for Tibet issues.
"The Chinese always make their views known when the Dalai Lama is in Washington," she said.

The US has the right to meet with whoever they want to, just like any other country. Who is china to tell them otherwise? The international community is not a tributary system that must pay homage and respect to ¡°the great middle kingdom.¡± Times have changed china, its time you caught up with the times. Furthermore, china needs to learn that it cannot bully, threaten and manipulate the international community the same way it bully¡¯s, threatens and manipulates its own people.

We will we meet and talk with the Dalai Lama. ¡­then we¡¯ll politely escort him out carrying a trash bag this time!

What is particularly galling about the PRC¡¯s attitude vis international diplomacy is that they want it both ways. They will not tolerate disapproval of their actions, but feel they have a right to threaten others for their conduct in affairs that concern China only indirectly.
