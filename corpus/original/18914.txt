(Reuters) - MGM Mirage (
Including a 44-cent-per-share gain on the sale of the Treasure Island resort, the No. 2 casino operator posted net income of $105.2 million, or 38 cents per share, compared with net income of $118.3 million, or 40 cents per share, in the year-earlier period.
Wall Street analysts, on average, had expected an adjusted loss of 5 cents a share on revenue of $1.58 billion.
MGM and Dubai World, joint venture partners in the CityCenter project now under construction on the Las Vegas Strip, settled a legal dispute last week over the $8.5 billion development and said they had secured financing, clearing the way for it to open by the year-end.
MGM, burdened by some $13.5 billion in debt, also gained a waiver from lenders giving it until June 30 to bring debt levels into line with financial covenants.
The company's holdings include nine Las Vegas Strip casino- hotels, gambling resorts in Mississippi and Michigan, as well as joint ventures in New Jersey and China's Macau.
MGM shares rose nearly 20.5 percent to close at $9.47 on the New York Stock Exchange before the earnings announcement. (Reporting by Deena Beasley; Editing by Andre Grenon)
