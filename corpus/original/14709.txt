In a bourse filing on Monday, the Saudi company clarified that these duties were imposed only on butanediol and not on methanol imports, adding that Chinese authorities would take a decision only after probing complaints of dumping by some companies.
According to its 2008 annual report, Sipchem made about 1.14 billion riyals ($304 million) from methanol sales in 2008, of which 49 percent was generated in Asia.
China said its investigation would determine whether the material -- used in blended gasoline -- has been dumped onto the Chinese market at prices below production costs, and ascertain the losses incurred by Chinese producers as a result.
It said investigations are normally completed within a year, but could be extended another six months in "special circumstances". The other three countries affected are Malaysia, Indonesia and New Zealand. (Reporting by Ulf Laessing; Editing by Thomas Atkins and Anthony Barker)
