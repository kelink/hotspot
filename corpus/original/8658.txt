(Reuters) - Tingyi Group (
), the company behind noodle brand Master Kong, said on Monday that it plans to raise about $440 million in a share offering in December, Taiwan's largest IPO from a company returning to its home base.
Each of the 380 million Taiwan Depository Receipts (TDR) issued will be worth half of the price of its Hong Kong-listed shares, although a final price had yet to be set, Tingyi said in a filing with the Taiwan Stock Exchange.
The company's announcement followed an earlier Reuters story about the TDR issue."
Reuters calculations based on the closing price of Tingyi's Hong Kong-listed stock valued the share issue at HK$3.4 billion ($438 million).
Sinopac Securities, a unit of Sinopac Financial (
), would be the lead underwriter for the share offering, Tingyi said.
Ten Taiwanese companies had applied to return to Taiwan for secondary listings, the Taiwan stock exchange said, four of which had successfully listed so far.
Tingyi made the announcement after the Hong Kong stock exchange closed on Monday. Its shares were up 2.87 percent, beating a 0.61 percent decline on the benchmark Hang Seng index
). Many Taiwan companies had previously chosen to list in Hong Kong or Singapore because of previous restrictions that kept them from listing at home if a large portion of their assets were based in China. The regulations have been eased or scrapped since the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou took office last May, in a bid to boost the island's economy and improve trade ties with China.
