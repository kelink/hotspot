Honda CEO says 2009/10 is floor for earnings

(Reuters) - Honda Motor Co's earnings will hit bottom this year and improve after that as demand in the United States returns in the second half, the Japanese automaker's chief executive said on Friday.
"The last (January-March) quarter was the nadir, and things will gradually start to improve in the first two quarters (of this year)," Takeo Fukui told Reuters in an interview.
"I'm definitely expecting the second half to turn up, and on an annual basis I think this year will be the floor."
Battered by a sales slump in the United States, its biggest market, Japan's No.2 automaker lost a net 186 billion yen ($2 billion) in the fourth quarter of 2008/09, a reversal from a profit of 25.4 billion yen a year earlier. For the year to March 2010, Honda has forecast a 71 percent drop in net profit to 40 billion yen.
A major culprit for the earnings deterioration across the industry in the past year has been the double-digit sales slide in the United States, which lost its claim to being the world's biggest auto market to China this year. But Fukui said he believed the U.S. market had also reached a bottom, projecting a recovery in the latter half of 2009.
"A 10 million unit (a year) market is abnormal for the United States," he said. "I think there's latent demand for 13 to 14 million units annually, and we'll get back to that level at some point."
