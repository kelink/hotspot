Taiwan local polls test pro-China party after shooting

(Reuters) - Taiwan began counting ballots on Saturday in tense races to choose mayors of the island's biggest cities, a test of the popularity of the China-friendly ruling party ahead of the 2012 presidential race.
Whichever party wins most of the five races will have a clear shot at the presidency, and a strong performance by the anti-China opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) could stoke concern in Beijing. Results will be announced later in the day.
"Some people will bear in mind the China issue today," said voter Liao Shao-an, 27, of Taipei. "Their judgment isn't too objective, either. They're guided by rigid party-line views."
Taiwan financial markets may slip in the short term if the DPP wins big on fears that the opposition's new clout might extend to the presidency and threaten trade deals with economic powerhouse China.
"Election results could weigh on sentiment," said Joanna Tan, economist with Forecast Ltd in Singapore. "ECFA is due for further talks next year, so that could delay the process."
Friday's shooting incident could generate sympathy votes for the KMT as Ma urged quick police follow-up on the case and called it an attack on Taiwan's 23-year-old democracy.
