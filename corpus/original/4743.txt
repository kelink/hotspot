Special Report: As China grows, contest intensifies for labor

(Reuters) - He Shuaixing shakes his head listening to the pitch from a job recruiter on a cold wet day in a factory district outside Shenzhen , epicenter of China's export machine.
The 26-year-old from the poor heartland province of Henan, like so many other workers, had just returned from his village after the Lunar New Year holidays and was looking for a job. But unlike an older generation of migrant workers, not just any job.
"It's easy to find work, but not easy to find good work," said He, wearing a thin grey jacket and a flop of gelled hair. "We haven't seen any big improvements in wages or benefits."
Besides, the booming metropolis of Shenzhen was getting too expensive, he complained.
Labor shortages in Chinese coastal factories are nothing new. The world's workshop has been churning out the exports again after hitting a lull during the global financial crisis. But workers like He are becoming more choosy about the kind of jobs they want, eschewing the long hours, tedious work and poor benefits offered in China's many sweatshops.
What's more, competition for Labor is now coming from new factories in China's rapidly urbanizing interior.
Chongqing (formerly Chungking), in southwestern Sichuan province and one of China's biggest cities, has launched a "Spring Breeze Action" campaign to recruit workers from the coast.
It has raised monthly blue-collar wages to around 1,200 yuan ($183), and is offering 300-yuan monthly subsidies to workers who take jobs in local factories.
Around 40,000 signed up on the first day alone. The wage in Chongqing compares to 2,000 yuan in southern China's manufacturing belt.
In Henan, a giant new Foxconn factory making iPhones will need several hundred thousand workers.
Fuyang, in eastern Anhui province -- a quarter of whose 9.5 million residents were migrant workers -- has recently dangled perks such as housing subsidies, TV-equipped dormitory rooms and health insurance to entice Labor to its new factories.
In response, authorities in some coastal regions have hiked minimum wages, raising expectations for further pay rises this year among workers squeezed by rising inflation.
Guangdong province, home to the Pearl River Delta, one of China's main manufacturing hubs, will raise minimum wages by an average of around 19 percent next month. Many factories, in fact, are already paying well above the minimum wage to retain and lure skilled workers.
Yiwu, a small city in coastal Zhejiang province is famous for the cheap goods it makes at hundreds of factories and workshops -- arts and crafts, hardware, cosmetics, household goods -- and exports around the world.
"Last year we were bringing carloads of workers back to our factory. It was very quick," said Wang Xia, a recruiter for a cosmetics factory sitting at her booth in an outdoor market.
New workers this year are asking for much higher starting salaries than older workers at her factory, she said.
"This is impossible," she fumed. "For this year, we have already increased our salary base and working benefits. This year, there are many job seekers who are just basically browsing around. The situation is most severe."
Standard Chartered Bank thinks China, with its one-child policy and transforming economy, will only generate three million new labor market entrants a year during 2011-15, compared with some 10 million a year in recent decades.
"The slowing growth (and then decline) of China's labor pool will clearly be negative for China's potential growth rate," wrote Standard Chartered economist Stephen Green in a research note titled "'Wanted': 25 million workers".
Despite the need for workers, many smaller factories operating on low margins and squeezed by recent sharp spikes in raw material prices, were unwilling to improve benefits, having already been forced to raise prices of their goods.
Some experts say the strains could accelerate industrial upgrading, automation and consolidation. More labor-intensive factories will close or move inland where cheaper land and labor often compensate for less developed supply chains and higher transport costs.
Other factories have quit China altogether, moving to lower cost countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh.
"I believe that some of the pressures now are even more serious than during the (2008) financial crisis," Zhou Dewen, the head of Wenzhou's Small and Medium Business Development Association, told Reuters Insider Television.
"If the (government) doesn't take good measures, this may cause 20 percent of factories to stop production, halt production or even shut down completely," Zhou added.
China's rusting, labor intensive coastal factories may be fighting a losing battle.
After the global financial crisis, which severely hit China's export-reliant $6 trillion economy, a shift seems apparent in government thinking.
The policy is clearly tilted toward boosting household income and creating a more consumption-led economy, to be less dependent on low-margin manufacturing exports, and travel up the value chain in manufacturing advanced technology products.
A relatively cheap yuan was once paramount in preserving the competitiveness of China's cheap exports. But the increasing importance of the consumer to the new economic equation argues for a stronger currency and higher wages to narrow the wide wealth gap between rural and urban areas.
For now, China's healthy export growth -- 37.7 percent in January from a year earlier -- has sustained a still substantial export engine, which some economists say accounts for around a fifth of its total economy.
But China's growing thirst for commodities -- imports overall in January surged 51 percent -- have contributed to a sharp spike in raw materials, whose rising costs pose an even more potent threat than higher wages for some factory owners.
Anil Mirwani, co-founder of "NV" brand jeans which retail in the United States and are made in a factory in Guangdong province, says wages only make up around a quarter of his total costs whereas fabrics make up around 55-60 percent.
"It's insane," he said of sharp rises in cotton yarn prices in China amid chronic global shortages of cotton supplies.
"We can cope, but it's been a real problem for us."
For China's vast army of 153 million migrant workers, the sting of rising inflation is growing, including food and rentals for the basic, often tiny rooms that are popular accommodation for millions in factory towns.
Despite bitter complaints about soaring prices, workers say they can scrimp enough to save at least a chunk of their wages.
While last year a spate of strikes crippled production at multinationals in China such as Honda Motor Co, few expect that kind of labor unrest this year with wages rising, if not as fast as many would like.
"There may be a small percentage of people that go on strike because the wages are too low," said Huang Hong, a veteran job recruiter in one of around 40 booths at the Wenzhou employment vocation center that was teeming with migrant workers.

To think that a laborer¡¯s monthly wages could go as high as $183 a month! What an outrage. Meanwhile, the U.S. federal minimum wage is $7.28 per hour. At that rate, a 40-hour week pays about $1,300 per month ¡ª about 7 times higher than wages for the same span of time in Chine. Suppose those rates eventually get averaged into one global labor pool. Since there are a lot more Chinese than U.S. people, the Chinese workers can expect to be doing significantly better, while American workers will be, uh¡­ well, the effects are pretty hard to picture from this suburban window. From another numeric standpoint, world GDP per capita is about $8600, while the U.S. earns around $47,000 per head, and Mainland China pulls in about $4000. (GDP per capita is not equal to wages, of course, but wages + amenities should be somewhere in the ballpark.) By this estimate, the U.S. minimum-wage worker pulls in about 12 times as much as his or her counterpart in China. Whether the GDP-based or wage-based back-of-envelope comparisons are closer to the truth, the ratios ¡ª 12:1 or 7:1 ¡ª tell pretty much the same story. It is clear from either perspective that the U.S. worker has much further to fall than the Chinese laborer can expect to rise.
