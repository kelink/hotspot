(Reuters) - Network equipment maker ADC Telecommunications Inc ADCT.O posted a better-than-expected second-quarter profit, helped by strong sales in China, and it forecast third-quarter revenue largely in line with market estimates.
The broadband data access and infrastructure equipment maker said it would further reduce its Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) workforce and take additional charges of $15 million to $25 million.
The company began to reduce the size of its EMEA workforce in the second quarter, resulting in a charge of about $3 million in the period.
For the second quarter ended May 1, the company reported a net loss of $10.9 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with a profit of $16.3 million, or 14 cents a share, a year ago.
Excluding charges, the company earned 5 cents a share.
Net sales fell 30 percent to $275.1 million, due to impact of the global recession across all of its businesses, the company said. ADC's China sales doubled to $24.7 million.
Analysts on average expected earnings of 2 cents a share, excluding items, on revenue of $265.9 million, according to Reuters Estimates.
The company said it expects net sales of $265 million to $290 million for the third quarter. It sees earnings of 4 cents to a loss of 4 cents a share, including items, for the period.
Analysts on average expected earnings of 7 cents a share, before items, on revenue of $277.3 million.
