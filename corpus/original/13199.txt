(Reuters) - The head of China's central bank said on Tuesday that U.S. and Chinese officials had few direct discussions on currencies in recent days and did not discuss the stability of the dollar or its status as the world's reserve currency.
"There were no detailed discussions over this issue," People's Bank of China chief Zhou Xiaochuan told reporters through an interpreter.
He also said China and other major economies will look to the United States' progress in emerging from recession to help them decide the timing of withdrawing their fiscal stimulus.
"If we are confirmed that the recovery of the U.S. economy is established and stable, if we see that the United States starts to exit its expansionary fiscal and monetary policy, then China will see what it will do at that time."
He added that other countries also will be watching the United States' actions due to its bellwether status, and added that China's first priority was to make sure that its economic stimulus policies "can deliver into the real economy."
The U.S. side has taken a softer approach to the thorny issue of China's yuan exchange rate, which many analysts and U.S. lawmakers believe is too low, providing China a trade advantage that costs U.S. jobs. Instead, U.S. officials have emphasized the need for China to spur more domestic consumption and rely less on exports for its economic growth.
Zhou said that U.S. officials had raised issue of the yuan-dollar exchange rate in the context of global trade imbalances, "but there was no response from the Chinese side."
"This was touched upon, but there was no full discussion over this issue," he said. (Reporting by David Lawder and Paul Eckert, Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
