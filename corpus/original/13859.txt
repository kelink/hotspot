Osaka-based Sekisui House said it plans to build 4,000 apartments and homes, and lots for 2,600 residences on the east coast cities of Sydney and Brisbane.
Homes will be constructed using Sekisui House's wooden housing platform, with building materials bought locally, said Sekisui House spokesman Masayoshi Kusunoki.
"We've been eyeing overseas business expansion for a while and did a lot of research. We then decided to launch this project considering Australia's growing population and its relatively stable property market," Kusunoki said.
"Australia also has a lot of natural resources, and we found growing business potential there," he added.
The company plans to sell apartment units, about 85-square metres in size, for between 300 billion yen to 500 billion yen.
Sekisui House's announcement follows Japan's biggest property developer, Mitsui Fudosan Co (
