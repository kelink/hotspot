(Reuters) - The United States wants a G8 summit this week to commit $15 billion over a multi-year period for agricultural development in poor countries to fight food insecurity, according to a draft declaration seen by Reuters.
"The funds...would be earmarked for investment in low income countries to implement agriculture development strategies, to finance agricultural infrastructure, land and water management, risk mitigation actions," the declaration said.
But the final paragraph of the statement left blank the total amount to be committed by its signatories, which is still the subject of negotiations.
The joint statement expressed "renewed concern for the triple impact of the economic downturn, food price volatility and under investments in agriculture on poverty and hunger".
The declaration on food security is due to be signed on the last day of the July 8-10 summit by leaders from the G8, Brazil, India, China, Mexico, South Africa, and African nations, amongst others.
Aid groups have welcomed the focus on agriculture, but caution this should not come at the expense of emergency food aid. They also urge G8 leaders to be transparent about what they would include in any amount of money committed to food security. (Reporting by Reuters bureaux; Editing by Jon Boyle)
