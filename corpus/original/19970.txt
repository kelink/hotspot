) said on Tuesday it priced its offering of Taiwan Depositary Receipts (TDRs) at the high end of their range, the first such offering under relaxed regulations in Taiwan.
Want Want China, a China-based food and beverage unit of Taiwan's Want Want Group, priced the TDRs at T$15.50 ($0.46 or HK$3.56) per TDR, compared with a previously indicated range of T$12.50 to T$15.50 [ID:nPEK47497], the company said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
Want Want China shares were down 1.84 percent in mid-day trading in Hong Kong at HK$3.73, versus a 3.70 percent decline for the broader Hang Seng Index
Want Want China said one of it shareholders intends to transfer 210 million ordinary shares of the company to Taiwan to issue 210 million TDRs, giving the offering a value of up to nearly $100 million.
But under the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou, who took office last May, many of those restrictions have been eased or scrapped in a bid to help boost the island's economy.
