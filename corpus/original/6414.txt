U.S. lags China on climate change: Europe climate chief

(Reuters) - The United States' future as a global economic power depends on what it does to fight global warming and it is lagging behind other countries like China, Europe's climate chief said on Wednesday.
"This is one of the crucial battlefields over who is going to be the economic leaders of our century," Hedegaard said of the fight against global warming.
Democratic Senator John Kerry and independent Senator Joseph Lieberman presented a long-awaited climate bill on Wednesday, which aims to cut planet-warming emissions by a 17 percent in the next decade.
While President Barack Obama supports the legislation, it has slim chances of passing unless Kerry and Lieberman win over a group of moderate Democrats and Republicans.
"It's not something an ordinary European citizen would say 'Wow, that's really ambitious,'" Hedegaard said. "On the other hand, we know that the United States has been among the later starters, so the important thing now is to get started."
While the United States and China bicker in negotiations for a new global deal to combat climate change, Hedegaard said Beijing was making great strides against global warming.
"The irony is that in the real world outside the negotiation rooms they are just moving," she said of China's efforts to fight global warming. "They are just doing it and they are doing it big scale."
"There is this feeling now that there is something to build upon," Hedegaard said.
