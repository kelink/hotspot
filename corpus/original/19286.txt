Table tennis-Lights shine bright for Japanese crybaby

(Reuters) - Japan's Ai Fukuhara, famous for bursting into tears on national television as a toddler, has been given top billing at the world table tennis championships before she has even pinged a ball in anger.
The 20-year-old brought practice to a standstill on Tuesday, spending more than two hours tossing balls high into the air to see how the lights at arena would affect her serve.
Japanese camera crews tripped over themselves to film Fukuhara, who has little realistic chance of disrupting China's dominance at the April 28-May 5 championships in Yokohama.
"I was working out exactly where to throw the ball into the lights," Fukuhara was quoted as saying in Japanese newspapers on Wednesday. "I'm beginning to get excited about the championships."
Fukuhara will take centre stage, with one of the courts already being christened "Ai-chan's Court" (Little Ai's Court).
Once the darling of the Japanese media, Fukuhara appeared regularly on TV shows as a child where she would throw tantrums and wail out loud if she lost a point to celebrities.
Earlier this year, eight-year-old Miu Hirano eclipsed Fukuhara's record by becoming the youngest player to appear at the Japanese championships.
Fukuhara, Japan's flag-bearer at the Beijing Olympics last August, was 10 when she first competed at national level in 1998.
The pint-sized Hirano, who can barely see over the net, and has to be coaxed away from her mother's side to play matches, is not appearing at the world championships.
Chinese players are expected to clean-sweep the medals in Japan, as they have at the last two world championships and the Beijing Games.
