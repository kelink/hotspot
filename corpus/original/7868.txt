(Reuters) - German generic drugmaker Ratiopharm has attracted at least 10 first-round bids, several people familiar with the procedure told Reuters on Wednesday, indicating that a competitive auction was underway.
Bidders from the healthcare industry include Israel's Teva (
), Mylan (
) of the United States, Sanofi-Aventis (
) of France, China's Sinopharm (
) and Actavis of Iceland, the sources said.
Buyout firms participating in the round of bids, which were non-binding, include TPG [TPG.UL], Advent in collaboration with Goldman Sachs (
), Permira [PERM.UL] and KKR [KKR.UL].
A spokesman for Ratiopharm, put up for sale to cut its owner's debt, declined to comment.
Teva, Actavis and all private equity companies named by the sources also declined comment.
Sanofi, Sinopharm and Mylan were not immediately available for comment.
A spokesman for Ratiopharm's parent, the Merckle family's investment vehicle VEM, said last week VEM was positively surprised by the number of bids and that it was "very satisfied" with the level of the offers.
Encouraged by the interest from suitors, the sale of Ratiopharm as a whole remained a priority, he said at the time.
