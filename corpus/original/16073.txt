(Reuters) - At their meeting in southern Italy on June 12-13, finance ministers from the Group of Eight nations described their economies in the most positive terms since the global credit crisis erupted nine months ago.
Following are ministers' comments about the economy at the meeting, and their comments two months ago at April meetings of the Group of Seven and Group of Twenty nations in Washington.
"There are signs of stabilisation in our economies, including a recovery of stock markets, a decline in interest rate spreads, improved business and consumer confidence, but the situation remains uncertain and significant risks remain to economic and financial stability."
"I am very cautious, but there are indeed indicators which show that there will be possibly a certain stabilisation.
"We must be very attentive and very careful...(The impact of the plunge in industrial production) is still being seen. We must not get wrapped up in the pick-up when we're still in the process of relaunching, stimulating and making sure the stimulus plans are working."
"The minister (Kaoru Yosano) said the U.S. economy is stabilising, which is encouraging. Geithner also said it has got significantly better."
"There are some indications that the real economy is improving in North America; these are early, relatively modest signs. First we will have stabilisation."
"We are right to be somewhat encouraged, but we would be wrong to conclude that we are close to emerging from the darkness that descended on the global economy early last fall."
"The economy is in recession but the pace of decline is slowing. That's a very cautious statement. Signs of stabilisation, that's also an expression with a question mark."
