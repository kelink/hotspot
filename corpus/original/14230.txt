LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - With "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs" monopolizing family filmgoers to remain the top film at the weekend overseas box office, newcomer "Bruno" drew audiences seeking raunchier fare.
Meanwhile, "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" saturates the international circuit beginning Wednesday.
The strictly 3D China debut of "Ice Age" drew an estimated $4.6 million, elevating the film's international total to $327.1 million -- $129.9 million shy of the $457 million total tallied by the biggest offshore grosser of the series to date, 2006's "Ice Age: The Meltdown." The latest film finished No. 1 in at least 23 of the markets it played.
The "Transformers" sequel opened in India ($1.3 million), and claimed the No. 1 spots in Italy and Korea. Its foreign gross since June 19 is $364.5 million, $24.5 million shy of the original's entire overseas gross.
Meanwhile, the Sacha Baron Cohen comedy about a flamboyantly gay Austrian fashion correspondent in Los Angeles opened simultaneously with its No. 1 domestic debut.
Baron Cohen, a British comedian, made his international mark three years ago with his first mockumentary, "Borat." For a comedy, the Fox release did especially well abroad, drawing $133.1 million overseas versus $129.2 million domestically.
The eight territories handled by Universal were dominant, particularly in the U.K. and Ireland, where the comedy opened at No. 1 with $8.1 million. Australia contributed $6.1 million and Germany $2.9 million. All told, the eight accounted for $20 million. The balance came from smaller territories handled by Sony or Mandate, such as the Nordic countries and Greece. A France opening via Sony is due July 22.
Finishing fourth was "Public Enemies," which drew $8 million from 17 markets for a total of $16.7 million. The Johnny Depp vehicle opened at No. 2 in France with $3.8 million. The crime drama has yet to play 47 territories.
Two films reported $7 million each: "The Proposal" and "The Hangover." "The Proposal," playing in 19 markets, has earned $40.7 million to date. "The Hangover" played in 33 territories for a solid total of $74.1 million.
