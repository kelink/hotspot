(Reuters) - Consumers of copper -- often seen as a barometer of economic health -- don't share the upbeat outlooks of many commodity trading banks, with most pointing to sparse order books and slow recovery from the global downturn.
Physical traders and consumers, who gathered for the annual London Metal Exchange Week events, described a base metals sector where prices on global markets do not reflect reality.
They also said imports of metals by top consumer China, the silver lining of a difficult 2009, are set to dip after a robust first half.
* Oct 7 - One of the world's largest private consumers of copper, Nexans (
) said it expected the physical copper market to be in surplus through 2010, even if an economic upturn awakens industry demand. [ID:nL7530052]
) says metal use could fall 20-30 percent in 2009 from 10,000-15,000 tonnes in 2008, but it sees signs of a slight recovery in 2010. The company reduced in-house stocks to about three months supply, or roughly 8,000-9,000 tonnes. [ID:nL2153257]
* Sept 18 - KME Group KME.MI, a leading maker of copper products, said its demand is seen recovering 10-15 percent in 2010 after falling nearly 30 percent in 2009 from the prior year. In 2008, the company's production also fell nearly 9 percent to 571,000 tonnes. [ID:nLI354492 ]
* Sept 17 - Swedish copper fabricator Elektrokoppar estimates wire rod output from its 160,000 tonne per year Helsingborg plant was down around 16-17 percent annually.
The company saw its consumption of copper at 145,000 tonnes in 2009, with some pickup later in the year from 70,000 tonnes in the first half. A further increase is expected in 2010.
It forecast a 3-5 percent rise in global copper demand in 2010, although the availability of physical metal will likely stay in surplus. [ID:nLF362394]
* Sept 15 - Europe's biggest copper smelter Aurubis (
) said copper product and cathode (new metal) demand remained low and spot copper treatment and refining charges (TC/RC) have fallen to below $20 a tonne and 2 cents a lb compared to $30/2 cents in early August, from $75/7.5 cents reported in March. [ID:nLF361591]

Copper and alloy products output is due to rise 968,300 tonnes in 2010 from 923,600 tonnes this year but still far from the nearly 1.19 million tonnes in 2008. For a full table of data see [ID:nLR725516]
