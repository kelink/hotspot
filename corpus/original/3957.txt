(Reuters) - China's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that it hoped the U.S. government would take a responsible attitude to protect investor interests, in Beijing's latest expression of concern about the possibility of Washington briefly defaulting on its debt.
Moody's Investors Service warned on Wednesday that the United States may lose its top credit rating in the coming weeks if the limit on American borrowing was not raised.
"We hope that the U.S. government adopts responsible policies and measures to guarantee the interests of investors," ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at a regular news briefing in Beijing, when asked about the Moody's report.
China, the United States' biggest creditor with more than $1 trillion in Treasury debt as of March, fears even a small default could destabilize the global economy and sour political relations.
Beijing has repeatedly warned that loose U.S. monetary policy threatens the dollar, but it has continued to accumulate dollar assets at the same time, adding about $260 billion of Treasury securities last year, according to U.S. data.
