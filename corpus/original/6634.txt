China says considering attending Iran nuclear meet

(Reuters) - China said on Tuesday it was considering whether to attend a nuclear disarmament conference in Tehran later this month, after Iran said the Chinese would take part.
Iran, embroiled in a deepening dispute with the West over its nuclear program, says experts and officials from 60 countries have been invited to the April 17-18 meeting called "Nuclear energy for everyone, nuclear arms for no one."
But Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said China's participation was not yet confirmed.
"We have received the invitation and are now studying it," Jiang told a news briefing without elaborating.
A member from the International Atomic Energy Agency's
secretariat will attend the meeting as an observer, said a spokesman for the agency.
The Vienna-based IAEA, which is investigating Iran, said in February it had concerns the Islamic Republic could be actively trying to develop a nuclear-armed missile. Iran says its atomic work is aimed at generating electricity so it can export more oil and gas.
China, which buys large amounts of oil from Iran, has for months fended off Western calls to back further U.N. Security Council sanctions on the Islamic state.
But in moves last week that could ease strained Sino-U.S. ties, China announced Hu would attend a April 12-13 nuclear security summit in Washington, while its diplomats signaled readiness to join serious talks with Western powers on new sanctions on Iran.
China is one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, each wielding the power to veto any resolution and thus block proposed U.N. sanctions.
