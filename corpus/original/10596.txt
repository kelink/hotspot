France sees slight opening in Iranian dialogue

(Reuters) - There is a small opening in the dialogue between Iran and the international community, even if Tehran must still answer questions over its suspected nuclear ambitions, French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said.
Noting Sunday's announcement by the IAEA nuclear agency that U.N. experts would inspect Iran's newly disclosed uranium enrichment plant on October 25, Kouchner said it was crucial to uncover the goals of Tehran's uranium enrichment efforts.
"We are ready to no longer speak about sanctions, but we need to discuss what we call the heart of the matter, that is to say: is this uranium enrichment dangerous or not?" Kouchner told RTL radio and LCI television.
Asked if Iran was pursuing a nuclear program for military ends, Kouchner said he was of the same view as Mohamed ElBaradei, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency.
"Everything leads us to think that they were at least tempted to do this and we are trying to put an end to this by extending investigations and making sure they cannot do this any more," he said.
Iran agreed with the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany in Geneva on Thursday to allow IAEA inspectors unfettered access to an underground nuclear fuel facility near the holy Shi'ite city of Qom.
The site had been kept secret until Iran disclosed its existence last month, setting off an international furor and fuelling suspicions in the West that the Islamic state has covertly sought to develop nuclear weapons. Iran denies this.
Last month, French President Nicolas Sarkozy accused Iran of putting the international community on a dangerous path and vowed that sanctions would be stepped up if Iran's leaders did not substantially change policy by December.
