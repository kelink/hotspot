(Reuters) - Asia, a continent that has battled deadly viruses such as the H5N1 bird flu and SARS in recent years, has been taking steps to ward off the new swine flu virus.
Swine flu has killed 103 people in Mexico. There are 20 cases in the United States and six in Canada, and possible cases as far afield as Europe, Israel and New Zealand.
Asian stocks fell about 2 percent as the outbreak of swine flu in North America hurt shares of airlines while prompting some market players to trim risky positions, hitting currencies such as the Australian dollar.
- New Zealand teacher who had led school group in Mexico is treated in hospital with flu-like symptoms. Ten students from same group are confirmed as having Influenza A, treated as likely swine flu sufferers. Results of tests expected Tuesday.
- Initial tests on another school group, also just back from Mexico, show 3 students with signs of Influenza A.
- Two suspected cases test negative. They had caused jitters in the foreign-exchange market, causing the local currency to pull back from offshore highs, analysts said.
- Temperature checks for all passengers, a procedure that has been in place since the SARS scare in 2003.
- China, which came in for criticism after initially covering up the SARS outbreak in 2003, promises to be open when it comes to swine flu.
- South Korea advises citizens to avoid travel to three regions in Mexico, including Mexico City.
- Shares in providers of chicken, beef and fish products and major pharmaceutical firms gain.
- Scans temperatures and looks for signs of respiratory infections from people arriving from U.S., Canada and Mexico.
- Hong Kong steps up port health protection measures, and sets up temperature screening machines at all checkpoints.
- Monitoring at airports via thermal cameras to find people with fever; health officials to board planes arriving from Mexico to check passengers, including using portable thermal sensors.
- Health Minister says will prioritize producing new vaccines, even if that means temporarily halting production of seasonal, winter ones.
- Temperature screening checkpoints at Suvarnabhumi Airport; no direct flights from Mexico.
- Travellers, particularly those coming from the countries already hit by the recent outbreak, to be screened.
