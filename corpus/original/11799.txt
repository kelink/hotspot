The mood among mainland Chinese investors was cautious, with the main index down as much as 18 percent in Tuesday's intraday trading from its 14-month high of 3,478 points hit two weeks ago.
"Investors are jittery that the big summer rally has finally come to an end. China's social security fund started selling stocks in July and that is enough to get others selling," said Francis Lun, general manager with Fulbright Securities.
Chinese insurers are close to their permissible investment limits in equities while the National Social Security Fund reduced its net exposure to Shenzhen-listed A shares by 664 million yuan in July, JP Morgan said in a note on Tuesday.
Analysts in Shanghai said the two-week slump had pushed valuations of China's stock market to much more reasonable levels, and the potential of sliding would be more limited in the near term.

Goldman Sachs raised its estimate for CITIC Pacific's 2009 per share earnings by 35 percent to factor in the disposal gain, but it cut its 2010 estimates by 5 percent and 2011 estimates by 11 percent to account for the lack of profit contribution from Cathay.

"Earlier this year, the index rose too much without a decent correction, and that caused a torrential fall recently," said senior analyst Zhang Qi at Haitong Securities.
"The pace of such a fall cannot be sustained, though we also do not expect the index to rebound sharply immediately, partly because of weakening overseas markets at the moment."
