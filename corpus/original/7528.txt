(Reuters) - Chinatrust Financial (
), which lost a bid to acquire AIG's (
) Taiwan life insurance unit, said on Tuesday it agreed to buy a 30 percent stake of it for $660 million from China Strategic (
In exchange, China Strategic would take a 9.95 percent Chinatrust stake, worth about T$20.8 billion ($648 million), via a private placement, Chinatrust said in a statement.
The acquisition comes after Chinatrust, the island's biggest credit card issuer, said earlier this month that it did not rule out taking legal action against the U.S. insurance giant.
Nan Shan is Taiwan's No. 3 life insurer by market share.
"Chinatrust has Taiwan's biggest bank insurance distribution network," Chinatrust said. "The combination will create the most synergy for Chinatrust and Nan Shan."
China Strategic would buy the shares of Chinatrust at T$17.74 each, the statement said, representing a 13 percent discount from Tuesday's closing price.
Both sides have signed a memorandum of understanding on Tuesday, it said.
The Nan Shan sale marked the largest disposal since the U.S. government bailed out AIG, which saved the insurer from collapse last year.
Before the announcement, Chinatrust stocks closed 3.3 percent lower at T$20.35, trailing the broader market's
0.76 percent slide. (Reporting by Faith Hung; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter) ($1=T$32.1)
