Puma, the world's No. 3 sporting goods group known for its leaping cat logo, avoided a similar collapse in earnings.
First-quarter operating results before special items fell to 114 million euros ($151.9 million) from 125.8 million euros. It was in line with the 113 million euro average estimate for EBIT in a Reuters poll of analysts, excluding restructuring charges.
Consolidated sales rose 0.8 percent on a currency-neutral basis to 697.4 million euros, meeting estimates.
"Due to the worldwide recession, we plan for business to remain challenging in 2009 and have therefore decided to implement further measures to align our cost structure with the current market environment, ensuring a platform for profitable growth in the future," said Chief Executive Jochen Zeitz.
To mitigate the impact from the global crisis Puma, owned by French retailer and Gucci owner PPR PTRP.PA, is cutting this year's investments, closing unprofitable stores, writing down the value of inventory and adjusting athletes' promotion deals.
Puma shares trade at about 11.3 times 12-month forecast earnings, roughly in line with Adidas, which has a multiple of 12.6, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine.
Both trade at a discount to Nike's multiple of 15, which it earns from its market-leading position. ($1=.7506 Euro) (Reporting by Eva Kuehnen)
