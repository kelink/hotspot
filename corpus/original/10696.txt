"When the crisis hit, for all the talk about the uncertainty of the dollar, the value of the dollar went up and that suggested it was seen as a safe haven and I don't see that changing in the near term," Zoellick told a panel hosted by France 24 TV.
But he reiterated his recently stated view that U.S. authorities should not take for granted the dollar's place as the world's predominant reserve currency, given increasing alternatives to the dollar.
China's central bank governor said in March the world should consider the International Monetary Fund's special drawing rights -- a basket of dollars, euros, sterling and yen -- as a super-sovereign currency to replace the dollar.
"The American public and American political leaders take for granted the unique status of having a reserve currency, which makes it a lot easier if you need to print money or raise debt," Zoellick said.
"If they take that for granted and continue to run large budget deficits and if spending gets out of control... we could lose what is an incredible, incredible thing to have," he added.
