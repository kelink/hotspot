"Throughout my trip and throughout my presidency, I intend to make clear that the United States is a Pacific nation and we will be deepening our engagement in this part of the world ... The United States will strengthen our alliances, build new partnerships and will be part of multilateral efforts and regional institutions that advance regional security and prosperity. We have to understand that the future of the United States and Asia is inextricably linked.
"The issues that matter most to our people -- economic growth and job creation, non proliferation, clean energy, these are all issues that have to be part of a joint agenda and we had very productive discussions about these issues this evening."
"In a few months, we will be marking the 50th anniversary of our alliance which is founded on shared values and shared interests that has served our people so well and has provided peace and security for the region in an unprecedented way.
"That anniversary ... represents an important opportunity to step back and reflect on what we've achieved, celebrate our friendship but also find ways to renew this alliance and refresh it for the 21st century. Both Yukio and I were elected on a promise of change.
"But there should be no doubt as we move our nations in a new direction, our alliance will endure and our efforts will be focused on revitalizing that friendship so that it's even stronger and more successful in meeting the challenges of the 21st century.
"It's essential for the United States, it's essential for Japan and it's essential for the Asia Pacific region."

"Let me first of all insist that the United States and Japan are equal partners. We have been and we will continue to be ... That's reflected in the Japan-U.S. alliance. It will be reflected in the resolution of the base realignment issues related to Futenma (Marine base).
"As the prime minister indicated, we discussed this.
"Our goal remains the same, and that's to provide for the defense of Japan with minimal intrusion on the lives of the people who share the space and I have to say that I am extraordinarily proud and grateful for the men and women in uniform from the United States who help us to honor our obligations to the alliance and our treaties."
