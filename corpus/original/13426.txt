(Reuters) - Shares of Consolidated Thompson Iron Mines Ltd CLM.TO jumped more than 16 percent on Thursday after China's Wuhan Iron and Steel Corp Ltd invested $240 million in the junior Canadian mining company.
WISCO said in a release it acquired 38,681,023 common shares, or around 20 percent, of Consolidated Thompson by way of a private placement earlier this week.
The Chinese company now holds a 25 percent interest in Consolidated Thompson's Bloom Lake iron ore project in Quebec and has committed to buy 50 percent of the ore produced at the mine.
The Chinese company -- the latest to buy into Canada's rich resource sector -- said its stake may increase or decrease depending on economic or market conditions.
"With the closing of this strategic investment, we have completed the funding associated with the Bloom Lake project while partnering with a leading integrated steel producer from China," Richard Quesnel, chief executive of Consolidated Thompson, said in a release.
The WISCO investment won approval from Canaccord Adams analyst Gary Lampard, who said in a note the deal removed financing risk from the Bloom Lake project.
Lampard also upgraded Consolidated Thompson to a "buy" from "speculative buy," and maintained a price target of C$5.15.
