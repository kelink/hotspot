) will likely end the April-June quarter with a group operating loss of about 20 billion yen, as sales of chips for use in information devices and automobiles remain weak, the Nikkei business daily said.
This would mark a fourth consecutive quarter of operating losses. The major chipmaker reported a 1.7 billion yen operating profit a year earlier, the paper said.
Quarterly sales will probably drop 40 percent on the year to slightly below 100 billion yen. Sales from chipmaking operations will likely decline 40 percent to about 95 billion yen, Nikkei added.
But NEC Electronics believes that the worst of the semiconductor demand slump has passed because customers are finishing up a round of inventory adjustments, the paper said.
It is already seeing a recovery in demand for flat-panel-television parts, whose sales have been growing in China, and a sharp rise in orders for microcontrollers for hybrid vehicles, the paper said.
As a result, the firm's factory utilization rate is expected to improve from the current 50 percent or so to 60 percent to 70 percent in the July-September quarter, Nikkei said.
If this effort succeeds, the firm should become lean enough to secure an operating profit on a factory utilization rate of around 70 percent. It may thus be able to sharply reduce operating losses in the July-September quarter or later, the paper said.
For the full year, NEC Electronics is working toward breaking even on an operating basis -- an improvement from the previous fiscal year's operating loss of 68.3 billion yen.
The company has reached a basic agreement with Renesas Technology Corp to integrate operations around next April, Nikkei said. (Reporting by Shailesh Kuber in Bangalore; Editing by Anil D'Silva)
