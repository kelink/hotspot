) has agreed to raise its stake in China's Chongqing Brewery Co Ltd ("CBC") to nearly 30 percent for about 2.1 billion crowns ($380 million) to further its Asian expansion.
Carlsberg, the world's fourth-biggest brewer, said on Thursday it would increase its stake in CBC to 29.71 percent from 17.46 percent.
The purchase price for the 12.25 percent stake is 40.22 yuan per share, or about 2.39 billion yuan, Carlsberg A/S said.
The transaction is conditional upon a number of steps and approvals by authorities and minority shareholders, it said.
"This is a natural extension of our growth strategy that we have voiced in the past couple of years that acquisitions will happen in Asia and particularly in China and Indochina," CFO Jorn Jensen told Reuters.
Jensen said the acquisition was strategically important to Carlsberg, and though the 2.1 billion crown price was high compared with other beer deals, it was inflated by biotech assets held by Chongqing.
Jensen said Carlsberg had a strong foothold in western China, so it would be looking eastwards for further acquisitions, "though not necessarily all the way to the coast."
He added that Carlsberg was not interested in buying brewing assets held by Australia's Foster's FGL.AX, which last month said it would split its beer division from its wine and spirits business.
Shares in Carlsberg traded up 2.3 percent at 494 crowns by 1244 GMT, after setting a new two-year high of 498 crowns. Its all-time highs of more than 600 crowns were set in October 2007.
CBC operates 15 breweries in China and produced about 10 million hectolitres of beer in 2009, Carlsberg said.
The Carlsberg group sold more than 135 million hectolitres of beer last year, which is about 40 billion bottles.
CBC is market leader in the Chongqing province and operates in the surrounding provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi and Hunan and in the eastern Chinese provinces of Anhui, Zhejiang and Jiangsu, Carlsberg said.
Nomura International has acted as financial advisor to Carlsberg, Carlsberg said.
