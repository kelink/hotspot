(Reuters) - Brazilian miner Vale's profits fell 65 percent in the third quarter compared to the year before on lower iron ore prices and production, a drop slightly less than analyst estimates of a 70 percent slump.
), the world's biggest iron ore producer, posted net profits of $1.68 billion compared with $4.82 billion near the peak of the commodities boom in 2008.
Earnings were up from last quarter's $790 million profits as iron ore prices rose around 10 percent and output hit 64 million tonnes compared to 58 million in the second quarter -- though still off 2008 highs of 86 million tonnes.
The average sale price of iron ore climbed to $57.23 per tonne, down from the year earlier price of $80.19 and up from last quarter's low of $47.82.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- a key measure of cash flow known as EBITDA -- was $3.01 billion compared with $6.37 billion a year earlier.
Vale's stock price closed down 4.54 pct on Wednesday on the Sao Paulo stock exchange at 37.85 reais, weighed down by a global commodities sell-off and global markets slide.
