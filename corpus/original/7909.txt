(Reuters) - German solar cell maker Q-Cells QCEG.DE said it expects to recover a $244.5 million bank guarantee linked to its recently ended wafer supply contract with Chinese solar company LDK (
"Q-Cells has already started the draw-down process of the bank guarantee and expects the respective sum to be transferred within the next days," the German company said in a statement.
Q-Cells, one of the world's largest makers of solar cells, had made a prepayment of $244.5 million shortly after it signed the contract with LDK in late 2007, when wafer prices were much higher.
This prepayment, secured by a German bank, was reclaimed by Q-Cells last week after it said LDK did not fulfil "significant contractual obligations". [ID:nL2352753]
LDK Solar on Wednesday said a Jiangxi court had issued a civil order freezing any payment of guaranteeing banks, aiming at preventing them from returning the prepayment made by Q-Cells.
"The outpayment of the guaranteed sum by the German bank is ... in no way affected by legal decisions in other jurisdictions such as China," Q-Cells said in a statement.
"Currently Q-Cells is in negotiations with LDK to find a mutual solution for the existing differences," Q-Cells said. (Reporting by Christoph Steitz in Frankfurt and Ajay Kamalakaran in Bangalore; editing by Simon Jessop)
