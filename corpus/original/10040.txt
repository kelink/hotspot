(Reuters) - Britain's competition for its first demonstration carbon capture and storage (CCS) unit is on track, ScottishPower, a unit of Spain's Iberdrola (

Last week, E.ON (
) said it would defer an investment decision to build a coal plant in Kingsnorth for up to three years, casting doubts the competition deadline of 2014 could be met [ID:nL7082010].
The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has reassured the company of the status of the competition, aimed at having a commercial scale CCS system up in running in Britain by 2014, ScottishPower said in a statement.
ScottishPower's consortium, including Shell UK Limited (

"With the USA, Canada and China catching up fast, it's vital that we continue in the race...and make it a reality," said Nick Horler, ScottishPower's chief executive.
On Monday Energy Secretary Steven Chu said the United States, the world's number two coal producer and consumer, could have 10 demonstration plants by 2016 and that the technology must be ready for global deployment by 2017-2019. [ID:nLC305374]
E.ON UK said it was still vying for funding in the competition, though it said it needed to talk to the DECC.
While ScottishPower plans to retro-fit CCS to its existing coal generator in Longannet in Fife, Scotland, E.ON and RWE plan to build a new facility for adding CCS at Kingsnorth and Tilbury respectively, both in the Thames Estuary near London. (Reporting by Nao Nakanishi)
