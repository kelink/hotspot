(Reuters) - Canadian oil and gas explorer Daylight Energy Ltd DAY.TO said on Sunday it has agreed to be acquired by China's Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corp for about C$2.2 billion.
The deal for Calgary, Alberta-based Daylight is for C$10.08 per share. That is more than double the closing price of Daylight's closing price of C$4.59 on Friday, but the company noted it is only a 43.6 percent premium over the 60-day weighted average trading price.
SIPC is a subsidiary of China Petrochemical Corp and undertakes overseas investments and operations in the upstream oil and gas sector, Daylight said in its release announcing the deal.

In April, China's biggest metals trading firm, Minmetals Resources, said it had offered C$6.3 billion to buy Sydney and Toronto-listed African copper producer Equinox Minerals EQNC.MU. However, it dropped its proposal not because of regulatory issues, but because Minmetals' offer was trumped by a $7.7 billion cash bid by Barrick Gold Corp (
Daylight said it expects its deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, to close before the end of the year.
Canaccord Genuity Corp is the financial advisor to Daylight, while CIBC World Markets is also advising Daylight's board. Barclays Capital is advising SIPC.
