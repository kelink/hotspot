(Reuters) - Some 50 international oil companies including Chinese firms have expressed interest in exploration of Ghana's giant Jubilee oilfield, Deputy Energy Minister Kwabena Donkor said on Friday.
"We have had about 50 companies wanting to invest in the upstream sector of our oil industry," he told reporters.
"Out of this, there are a number of Chinese companies -- China is the single largest investor in the world and we'd have been surprised if they had not approached us," Donkor said.
Donkor added that Ghana has also received offers from U.S. and Scandinavian oil companies, without elaborating.
He said Energy Minister Oteng Adjei was in China on business relating to the energy sector and declined comment on whether the minister's trip had anything to do with Jubilee.
Ghana's local GNPC petroleum company is also interested in the asset, GNPC sources have said. (Reporting by Kwasi Kpodo; editing by Mark John)
