(Reuters) - Tensions between India and China are in focus this month, with the Dalai Lama visiting the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, and another round of talks on a disputed border area set to begin.
The government is in a strong position to press forward with an ambitious economic reform agenda, if it has the will. But the 2009/10 budget disappointed those who hoped for swift progress on reforms, and expectations of early progress on foreign direct investment have also proved over-optimistic. [ID:nDEL307483]
-- Markets will be watching for moves to privatise some state firms, relax restrictions on foreign direct investment, ease restrictions on foreign banks, and reform labour laws. The government has also pledged to reform India's tax laws, which markets would regard positively.
India will play a central role in determining whether the Doha round at the WTO can finally be concluded. The government's strong mandate and relatively secure position may allow it more flexibility in reaching agreement even if this is opposed by some powerful interest groups. But India continues to show an ambivalent attitude towards freer trade. Though New Delhi has pushed ahead with bilateral agreements and favours an ambitious timetable for sealing a Doha deal, it has raised protectionist barriers on some imports this year.
-- Any sign that India -- and the United States -- are more prepared to make concessions. Progress will require compromise on all sides. The next Doha meetings, scheduled for late November, could show how flexible key players are prepared to be.
Relations with Pakistan have recovered from the depths plumbed in the aftermath of the November militant attack on Mumbai, and India made the important concession in July of delinking the resumption of bilateral talks from Pakistan's progress in cracking down on terrorism. But further militant attacks or confrontations at the border still have the potential to cause a sudden spiralling of tensions. Military conflict remains only a very slim possibility but cannot be ruled out.
Ties between India and China have soured with the resurgence of a long-festering border dispute over the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. Reports of border incursions sparked unease. India also balks at Beijing's support for projects in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and a separate visa policy for Indian Kashmiris, which New Delhi sees as undermining its claim over the region. There is little chance of war between the two countries but further disputes could sour their booming trade relationship.
-- Progress on resuming substantive talks with Pakistan. The meeting of foreign ministers in New York did not lead to any announcement of renewed wide-ranging peace talks, with India still reluctant to make any concessions until more is done in Pakistan to deal with those behind the Mumbai attacks. But any sign of rapprochement will be greeted positively by investors.
-- The Dalai Lama's planned trip to Arunachal Pradesh on Nov. 8 has already raised hackles. Beijing strongly opposed the visit, which it says is part of the exiled Tibetan monk's separatist scheming. India has dug in its heels, calling the Dalai Lama an "honoured guest" whose visit has no political motive. [ID:nHAN462055]
-- The next round of talks over the disputed border with China in mid-November. Years of dialogue on the future of Arunachal Pradesh have made scant progress, but the talks open a window for both sides to diffuse tensions. [ID:nHAN507986]
The risk of violent attacks in India by domestic insurgent groups or foreign militants remains high. Al Qaeda and affiliated groups see India as a key battleground, and Pakistan is likely to remain a haven for militants seeking to launch attacks in India. Indian security forces are also grappling with a Maoist insurgency spreading across large swathes of countryside, much of it rich in minerals.
-- The danger of new attacks. Both Israel and Australia have issued warnings against travel to India, citing intelligence that more attacks may be imminent. Investors have already priced in the threat level in India, as the muted market reaction to the Mumbai attacks showed, but attacks that caused a serious deterioration in relations with Pakistan would be market-negative.
-- India plans to launch a large scale offensive against the Maoists soon -- a key test of the government's ability to tackle the insurgency and unlock potential investment in rebel-occupied territory. [ID:nDEL261855]
India's central bank has maintained an accommodative monetary policy to help the country weather the global economic crisis, but a conflict may be brewing between the bank and the government about the appropriate timing of a policy tightening. The central bank has shown increasing concern about inflation, while the government insists policy should continue to focus on growth. [ID:nDEL293565]
