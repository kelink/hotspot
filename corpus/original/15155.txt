* The key Tokyo Commodity Exchange rubber contract for December delivery <0#JRU:> was at 156.4 yen per kg at 0543 GMT, down 3.2 yen or 2 percent from Friday, after moving between 156.1 yen and 159.8 yen.
* Traders said that while a recovery in weather conditions, after unseasonal rain disruptions, put supply on track, the market lacked momentum to test its upside as industrial demand remained slack amid a lack of signs of a strong economic pickup.
* "Even when auto production starts to show some signs of recovery, supply is unlikely to get tight anytime soon given that rubber stocks are generally still abundant," said a manager at a Japanese securities firm.
* U.S. crude oil CLc1 slipped below $69 a barrel on Monday, after falling over a dollar in the previous session, ahead of the release of several key economic indicators which could provide direction. [O/R]
