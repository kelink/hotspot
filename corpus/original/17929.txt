METALS-Copper retreats from 1-week high, US housing weighs

(Reuters) - A record low in new U.S. home construction dragged the price of copper away from a one-week high on Tuesday, and dampened recent stock market induced optimism that the worst of the global economic downturn was over.
"It is certainly throwing into question a rebound in housing at least for this quarter," said Frank Lesh, broker and futures analyst with Future Path Trading in Chicago.
"If at any time we should really be looking at gains in housing and building permits, it should be now. This is the peak building time and demand period. What does this data say about that?" he questioned.
Copper for July delivery HGN9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division eased 0.25 cent to close at $2.0695 a lb, pulling back from an early peak at $2.1290 -- its highest level since May 12.
On the London Metal Exchange (LME), copper for three-months delivery MCU3 rose to a one-week high of $4,673.75 a tonne before trimming those gains to close at $4,550 a tonne, up $30 from Monday's close.
"There was no fundamental reason for copper's rise," said Abe Ulusal, metals trader at Mitsui Bussan Commodities. "I believe funds have been long, expecting the permits to rise. But when the data came out falling, the sell-off started."
"We don't see Chinese buying as strong as before and the demand in North America is very weak," Ulusal said, adding the massive rise in aluminum inventories would be a good example to reflect the weak demand for basic raw materials.
LME three-month aluminum MAL3 closed down $20 at $1,500 a tonne.
Part of the reason behind the rally in copper prices this year -- about 50 percent -- has been stockpiling by China, the world's largest consumer.
But that, analysts say, is coming to an end and a seasonal lull in industrial activity over the next few months will also weigh on copper, as will the realization that prices are now too high for China's State Reserves Bureau and consumers.
"We maintain our near-term bearish bias ... as we believe that the impact of the China-led rally has largely played out," Goldman Sachs said in a note.
However, metals markets will closely watch LME stocks, which for copper have fallen to around 350,000 tonnes, a drop of nearly 60 percent since late February and the lowest since early January, for clues to demand.
"But I don't think the Chinese will be buying at current prices," Weinberg said.
Prices of steel materials zinc MZN3 and nickel MNI3 traded at $1,526 a tonne and $12,465 a tonne from $1,518 and $12,350 respectively, while battery material lead MPB3 changed hands at $1,485 from Monday's last quote at $1,485.
Tin MSN3 was last quoted at $13,625/13,650 from $13,650 on Monday.
