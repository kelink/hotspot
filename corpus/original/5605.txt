Attorney General Holder to raise Nobel case in China

(Reuters) - The Attorney General said on Tuesday he would urge China to release Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo during an upcoming visit to Beijing, the first such visit by a senior U.S. official since the dissident won the award.
With China and the United States already at odds over the Chinese currency, Eric Holder said he would still raise human rights with his hosts during his visit to the Chinese capital.
"Certainty that will be something that will come up during the conversation that I will have in Beijing," Holder told reporters in Hong Kong.
Liu, who is currently serving an 11-year jail term on subversion charges, was awarded the Nobel Peace prize earlier this month.
"It is our feeling that the Nobel Peace Prize that he received was well deserved. We think that he should be released from detention. China should live up to its international human rights obligations," Holder said, reiterating earlier comments by President Barack Obama.
Holder said, however, that Liu's case wouldn't necessarily be the major focus of discussions with the Chinese.
China's ruling Communist Party has long reacted angrily to pressure over its restrictions on political and legal rights of its citizens.
Separately, Holder said he hoped to "lay the groundwork" for future cooperation between the U.S. and China on intellectual property protection, with China long identified by global anti-piracy advocates as a black spot for counterfeit goods.
"Protecting intellectual property is a top priority for the United States," he said.
