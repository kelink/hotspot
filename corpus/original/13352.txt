"In an economy where knowledge is the most valuable commodity a person and a country have to offer, the best jobs will go to the best educated, whether they live in the United States, or India, or China," Obama said.
The president wants states to use funds from the competition, dubbed the "Race to the Top," to ease limits on so-called charter schools, link teacher pay to student achievement and move toward common U.S. academic standards.
"America will not succeed in the 21st century unless we do a far better job in educating our sons and daughters," Obama said in an address at the Department of Education.
"Rather than divvying it up and handing it out, we are letting states and districts compete for it. That's how we can incentivize excellence and spur reform and launch a race for the top in America's public schools," he said.
The United States has one of the worst high school dropout rates in the industrialized world, and its students often rank below those in other Western nations in reading and math.
