(Reuters) - Japan's foreign minister chided Beijing Monday for a lack of transparency about its nuclear arsenal ahead of Prime Minister Taro Aso's visit to China this week.
In a speech outlining an 11-point initiative for global nuclear disarmament, Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone backed U.S. President Barack Obama's recent call for a nuclear-free world. He also said North Korea's ballistic missile development was a source of suspicion and tension around the world.
"China continues to modernize its nuclear arsenals and has not undertaken any nuclear arms reductions," Nakasone said. "Nor does the country disclose any information on its nuclear arsenal."
Aso is expected to raise the issue of the lack of transparency in Beijing's military spending when he meets Chinese leaders Wednesday and Thursday.
Nakasone said Japan, the only country that suffered from atomic bombs, wanted to host an international conference to discuss global nuclear disarmament early next year ahead of the 2010 review conference of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the pact that aims to prevent the spread of nuclear arms.
Japan has for decades banned the possession, production and import of nuclear arms but relies on a U.S. "nuclear umbrella" for its protection.
Nakasone also urged India, Pakistan and Israel to join the NPT as non-nuclear powers, while stressing the need for Iran to adhere to U.N. resolutions on its uranium enrichment to win confidence from the international community.
