(Reuters) - Contract chip maker Chartered Semiconductor CSMF.SI CHRT.O booked its fourth straight quarterly loss in the second quarter, but the loss narrowed from the previous three months on recovering chip demand.
The Singapore-based company forecast third-quarter loss would narrow further, as sales of computers and other consumer gadgets gather steam.
Chartered posted a net loss of $42 million in April-June, reversing a net profit of $40.9 million in the year-ago period.
The result was narrower than a consensus forecast of $53.5 million loss, according to Reuters Estimates.
"As we go into the third quarter, we are seeing healthy sequential growth in our business," Chartered CFO George Thomas said in a statement.
Chartered ranks alongside China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) (
) in the $20 billion chip foundry market, which is dominated by larger rivals TSMC (
TSMC probably made its largest profit in three quarters in the second quarter, while money-losing rival UMC could have returned to the black thanks to growing demand. [ID:nTP35599]
