) are waiting for a recovery in spending by manufacturers on robots, lasers, sensors and other equipment used to run their plants.
But the company, which reported its first first-half net loss in a decade, said that while there were "patches of recovery" -- such as in flat panel equipment or in China -- it was assuming that there would be no sudden recovery in consumer demand or in capital spending in the remaining months through March.
"Autos equipment sales were helped by incentives, but factory automation demand remains severe," Hiroki Yoshimatsu, an executive officer at Mitsubishi Electric, told reporters at a news conference. "Things are better in places, but this recovery lacks strength."
Mitsubishi Electric kept its annual outlook for a net loss of 20 billion yen unchanged, and below a consensus estimate of a 1.5 billion yen loss by 16 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The company, known for its conservative estimates, said that to make that target, it has lifted its annual cost cut target to 60 billion yen from a previously planned 40 billion yen.
It said it tumbled to a net loss of 25.8 billion yen in the six months through September, down from a 79.4 billion yen profit a year earlier on a 19 percent fall in sales. Its operating income came to 15.6 billion yen, beating its earlier target to break even.
