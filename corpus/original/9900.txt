1) CHINA (annual emissions of greenhouse gases: 6.8 billion tons, 5.5 tons per capita)
2) UNITED STATES (6.4 billion tons, 21.2 tons per capita)
* Emissions - President Barack Obama wants to cut U.S. emissions back to 1990 levels by 2020 and by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. For 2020, that means a 14 percent cut from 2007 levels.
"We will press ahead with deep cuts in emissions to reach the goals that we set for 2020, and eventually 2050," he told the United Nations on September 23, adding that the days when the United States "dragged its feet" were over.
* Demands - "We cannot meet this challenge unless all the largest emitters of greenhouse gas pollution act together," Obama said.
3) EUROPEAN UNION (5.03 billion tons, 10.2 tons per capita)
* Finance - EU leaders have agreed that developing nations will need about 100 billion euros ($146.8 billion) a year by 2020 to help them curb emissions and adapt to changes such as floods or heatwaves. As an advance payment, they suggest 5-7 billion a year between 2010 and 2012.
4) RUSSIA (1.7 billion tons, 11.9 tons per capita)
* Emissions - President Dmitry Medvedev said in June that Russia's emissions would be around 10 to 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. That means a rise from now -- emissions were 34 percent below 1990 levels in 2007.
5) INDIA (1.4 billion tons, 1.2 tons per capita)
* Emissions - India is prepared to quantify the amount of greenhouse gas emissions it could cut with domestic actions to fight climate change, but will not accept internationally binding targets, Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh said on September 17. [ID:nDEL381436]. India has said its per capita emissions will never rise to match those of developed nations.
* Demands - Like China, India wants developed nations to cut emissions by at least 40 percent by 2020. Ramesh said on October 10 that nations should scale down ambitions for Copenhagen from "exaggerated expectations.
6) JAPAN (1.4 billion tons, 11.0 tons per capita)
* Emissions - New Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama wants to cut Japan's emissions by 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 if Copenhagen agrees an ambitious deal, toughening a goal set by the previous government of an eight percent reduction.
* Finance - Hatoyama told the United Nations on September 22 that Tokyo would also step up aid. "Japan is prepared to offer more financial and technical assistance than in the past, in accordance with the progress of the international negotiations," he said.
