INSTANT VIEW: China Q2 GDP growth rises
2009-07-15 22:35:00.0
(Reuters) - China's annual GDP growth accelerated to 7.9 percent in the second quarter from 6.1 percent in the first quarter, as a surge in bank lending and government spending made it the best-performing major economy in the world. The GDP figure, announced by the government on Thursday, was accompanied a by a batch of data for June that showed the Chinese recovery was spreading more broadly, with private investment and consumption posting healthy rises.
DANIEL SOH, ECONOMIST AT FORECAST IN SINGAPORE:
"It's very encouraging, the 8 percent growth target in sight.
"The composition of medium-and-long-term loans to total loans rose. That, plus today's data, means that China's economic recovery is set to extend going forward, even when fiscal stimulus effects wane in the fourth quarter of 2009."
"It's by now clear that the fiscal stimulus package has offset the contraction in export activity.
"We predict growth of 9 percent year-on-year and above for the third quarter, followed by high 8 percent growth in the fourth quarter.
BEN SIMPFENDORFER, CHINA ECONOMIST AT RBS IN HONG KONG
"I've just revised up my full-year (GDP) forecast to 8 percent from 7 percent on this data. I was expecting a much lower figure.
The important message here is that while the pace of growth is accelerating, the quality is deteriorating. Growth is too reliant on public investment and residential investment. It's not sustainable.
"Retail sales figures are probably the poorest of the monthly data. It's nice to see they are stronger but anecdotal information from department stores suggests they are stable to stronger. Obviously I'd like to see more rebalancing (toward private consumption) but that's years away."
HAO DAMING, SENIOR ECONOMIST AT GALAXY SECURITIES IN BEIJING
"Industrial output growth accelerated, showing the destocking period is near the end.
"Investment is slower than expected, but I think the actual amount is about the same as in May. The investment growth will accelerate in the third quarter and become even faster in the last quarter of this year.
"The risk for next year is that investment growth will not be as fast as this year. Real estate investment in 2010 will also slow down, due to high prices.
"The central bank will tighten monetary policies in the second half, via credit quota and open market operations.
XING ZIQIANG, ANALYST AT CICC SECURITIES IN BEIJING:
"The government's stimulus policy play a dominant role in bringing up the economy. Our calculations show that government policies, including the 4 trillion yuan stimulus package, contributed about 6 percentage points for the 7.1 percent for the first half."
-- China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index
-- Since 1978, China has averaged GDP growth of close to 10 percent a year, but the government has had to ramp up spending and shift to extremely loose monetary policy to put the country on track for the official target of 8 percent growth in 2009.
-- Just a few months ago, many economists thought China's growth would be in the 6-7 percent range this year. However, with investment surging and consumption growing steadily, the consensus growth forecast has been increased to 8 percent.
-- The one piece of the puzzle still missing is exports. The collapse in U.S. and European demand means that China's trade surplus will shrink this year and probably contribute nothing to, or even act as a drag on, GDP growth.
-- The central bank cut interest rates five times in the final months of 2008 but has marked time this year. Economists expect it to stand pat as it waits for growth to gain traction, though it has begun to tweak monetary policy at the margins, issuing more bills and pushing yields higher to mop up some of the excess liquidity from the lending spree.
