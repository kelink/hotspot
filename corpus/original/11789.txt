Rupert Murdoch's News Corp overhauls Asia unit

(Reuters) - Star TV, the Asia flagship of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, on Tuesday announced a restructuring that will see it cut around 30 percent of its Hong Kong headquarters staff to focus on the lucrative India market.
Star TV CEO Paul Aiello will also resign under the overhaul announced by James Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch's son and chief executive of Europe and Asia for News Corp.
The company will cut about 150-200 people of the 550 people it currently employs at its Hong Kong headquarters, or about 30 percent of its staff, said spokeswoman Jannie Poon.
From its current centralized structure, Star will restructure into three units -- Star India, Star Greater China and Fox international Channels.
The move is a nod to the growing importance of India to Star, with the market now accounting for more than 70 percent of the company's revenue. Star's success in India has spurred periodic market talk of an eventual public listing for the unit, although Star has never publicly discussed such a possibility.
In sharp contrast to India, Star has struggled in China, for which Rupert Murdoch once held out great hopes. Other major foreign media such as Viacom, Disney and Time Warner have struggled there as well, as Beijing keeps them on a tight leash in the politically sensitive sector.
