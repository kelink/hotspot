The Scandinavian airline must carry out reductions of staff costs earlier than planned due to the weaker economy and will begin talks with labour unions shortly, business daily Dagens Industri reported, citing SAS CEO Mats Jansson.
"It could mean savings related to wages, per diems, pensions, working hours and by cutting the work force. The most important is not how get there but that we do it," he was quoted as saying. "We are in a hurry. This is not something that can wait until after the vacations."
