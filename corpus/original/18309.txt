(Reuters) - Belgian steel cord and wire manufacturer Bekaert (
) reported stable first-quarter consolidated sales on Wednesday and reiterated it did not expect the slowdown in activity to persist broadly across the company's activities.
"The first-quarter figures demonstrate that the low level of activity will not persist," Chief Executive Bert De Graeve told investors later on Tuesday at the group's annual shareholders meeting.
"Europe is a little more difficult but we hope that there it will not be long-term either," he added.
The group, whose products are used to reinforce tyres and concrete, said market visibility remained limited and therefore did not revise its outlook.
Bekaert, which also produces window film for houses and cars to insulate against heat and hold glass shards, has a quarter of the world's market share in steel cord.
The automotive industry is one of its largest markets, but sales are largely driven by the replacement market in that sector, which is less sensitive to economic downturns, the group said in a statement.
Net debt increased to 697 million euros from 627 million euros at the end of 2008, mainly because of the integration of wire product manufacturers Prodac in Peru and Ideal Alambrec in Ecuador, and the impact of exchange rate movements, the group said.
De Graeve said he was comfortable with Bekaert's debt level.
"The net debt is perfectly under control," De Graeve said.
Bekaert is active in Europe, North and Latin America and in Asia and is rapidly expanding its activities in China, where it has about 7,000 staff, one third of its total workforce.
At 1330 GMT, Bekaert shares were 1.1 percent lower at 70.2 euros, against a 0.7 percent drop for the wider Bel20
