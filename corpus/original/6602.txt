Factbox: Key political risks to watch in Kyrgystan turmoil

(Reuters) - Following this week's uprising in Kyrgyzstan, the main questions are whether the violence continues and how the United States, Russia and China react to turmoil in a country where all have interests.
The United States leases the Manas airbase to support NATO troops in Afghanistan. Russia also leases a base, while China has a long border with the country and will be concerned for the growing numbers of Chinese residents and businesses there.
Domestic strains appear to be the main reason for the uprising, but the new self-proclaimed government has signaled that the event was Russian-backed. A Russian official has said that Moscow alone should have a base in Kyrgyzstan, while the new Kyrgyz leadership has said it might shorten the U.S. lease.
After at least 75 people were killed in the uprising that forced President Kurmanbek Bakiyev to flee to his southern stronghold, an uneasy calm looks to have returned on Friday to the burned out center of the capital Bishkek.
The new leadership, led by former opposition leader Roza Otunbayeva, looks to be in control of the security forces, some of whom fired on opposition demonstrators on Wednesday.
Sporadic gunfire was heard on Thursday night as police and vigilantes battled looters. The self-proclaimed government says Bakiyev's supporters are stoking violence in the capital and are not preparing to surrender, but said it would not allow civil war. It has also offered Bakiyev safe passage from the country should he resign.
-- Does Bakiyev concede power? If not, does he have sufficient support to attack in Bishkek or control areas in the south where he has his power base? Do outside powers continue to recognize him as the president, or quietly abandon him?
-- What happens with the security forces? So far, they look to have switched loyalty to the new leadership. Is this the case across the country, particularly in the south? What happens to those security force commanders involved in shooting opposition demonstrators earlier this week?
-- Does looting continue and is it put down? Does it develop an ethnic overtone and target Chinese businesses in the capital, as some previous violence has? If so, how would China react?
For now, the key face-off is between the United States and Russia, although neither publicly acknowledges this. It is oddly juxtaposed with Thursday's signing in Prague of a nuclear arms reduction treaty by presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev.
Washington's priority will be keeping its Manas base open, while a Russian official with Medvedev's delegation said on Thursday Moscow wanted it closed.
A senior White House adviser on Russia told reporters in Prague: "This is not some anti-American coup. That we know for sure, and this is not a sponsored-by-the-Russians coup."
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has denied Russia played a part in the turmoil, but a Kyrgrz opposition leader Omurbek Takebayev said "Russia played its role in ousting Bakiyev."
-- How overt is Russian support for the self-proclaimed government, not to mention pressure to close the base? Russia is the only major country to recognize the new government so far. Putin called Otunbayeva on Thursday and asked how Russia could help. Moscow could promise financial aid, which might be tied to Kyrgyzstan shortening the U.S. base lease. Does Russia offer military support? It said on Thursday it had sent paratroopers to its base there, but only to protect Russian interests.
-- Does the uprising worsen Russia-U.S. relations just as Washington hoped they were improving?
-- Do other countries -- particularly the United States and China -- ultimately recognize the self-proclaimed government or continue to support the ousted leadership? So far, the U.S. line has been that it is not clear who is in charge.
-- How does China react? Analysts say it had lent money to the ousted government. Does it shift to the new rulers, perhaps sweetening relations with a new loan, or support Bakiyev tacitly or overtly? Does it make any comment on the U.S. base issue?
The United States cut back flights through Manas in the immediate aftermath of the violence but resumed operations on Friday. Officials say it has been central to the war effort in Afghanistan, allowing round-the-clock combat airlift, airdrop, medical evacuation and areal refueling.
It will be important for sending 30,000 more troops to fight the Taliban but Pentagon officials say they have other options and the base is not in itself essential.
U.S. officials say only around 20 percent of their supplies into Afghanistan go by air, with 30 percent transported overland through former Soviet states and 50 percent by road through Pakistan, a route which is vulnerable to attack on the Afghan and Pakistani side of the border.
-- what happens to the base? Do the new rulers demand a renegotiation or shortening of the lease, or outright immediate U.S. departure, which might complicate NATO's plans to escalate operations over the Afghan summer? In the meantime, it is able to operate fully?
-- Does the U.S. begin other options? The U.S. military say it is premature to discuss what they would do if they lost Manas. They have overflight and some landing rights in other central Asian states, but analysts say finding a new hub would be hard. On the other hand, a U.S. base would probably give a financial windfall to any central Asian country that offered it.
-- Does the dispute prompt Washington to rethink its strategy of relying heavily on transport through the Russian sphere of influence?
Kyrgyzstan's economic problems are seen as a big factor in the uprising, with recent tariff increases unpopular and many people angry about alleged government corruption and recent privatization deals. The self-proclaimed government says it badly needs financial aid.
However, 40 percent of gross domestic product is estimated to come from remittances from Kyrgyz workers in Russia, Russia's Uralsib says.
Foreign investors are mainly Russian and Chinese, with little western interest outside the small gold mining sector. Canadian mining company Centerra Gold and London-listed Chaarat Gold Holdings Ltd, both of which operate in the country, have seen their shares fall during the crisis.
Kyrgyzstan has no significant oil and gas reserves, although Russia's Gazprom is involved in exploration.
-- how long does the crisis last? Analysts say there is already little western interest in investing but say buying insurance at present would probably be impossible, potentially prompting delays in any planned ventures.
-- Does Russia or others provide financial aid, or does the U.S. agree to pay more for its base?
-- Most analysts say the uprising does not mean other central Asian states are less stable, but do investors view events as a sign of heightened regional risk and charge higher premiums for investing in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and elsewhere?
