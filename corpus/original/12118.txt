(Reuters) - Australian coal seam gas producer Arrow Energy Ltd AOE.AX has held talks over the possible sale of some of its assets, it said on Thursday, sending its shares up over 7 percent.
In a response to a stock exchange query on recent share price moves, it said it was not aware of any takeover interest after media reports that Royal Dutch Shell (
), Arrow's partner in Australia, and PetroChina (
), its Chinese partner, may make a bid.
Speculation has been rife in recent months that Shell may make a bid for the firm to get a larger foothold in Arrow's coal seam gas resources in Australia, which Shell needs to underpin a proposed liquefied natural gas project in the northeastern state of Queensland.
"If Shell is serious about its coal seam gas-to-LNG ambitions, they are going to need to get a firm hold of the gas assets, and Arrow appears to be the most natural target," said an analyst at a major investment bank who declined to be identified.
Arrow said that although it has ongoing dealings with a number of Chinese firms over its projects in China, it was not aware of any Chinese interest in Arrow.
Expectations of a sale of some assets and hopes of a takeover bid pushed Arrow's shares up 8 percent to A$4.47 by 0213 GMT, after earlier hitting a high of A$4.53. Its shares have gained about 9.7 percent this week.
Shell paid A$776 million for a stake in some of Arrow's coal-seam gas assets in 2008.
Apart from a deal to supply coal seam gas for Shell's proposed LNG project, Arrow is also supplying gas to a smaller-scale gas export project being built by Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd (
The Australian Financial Review newspaper reported on Wednesday, without citing any sources, that Arrow may finalise a liquefied natural gas (LNG) deal with Shell later this week. (Reporting by Fayen Wong, editing by Jonathan Standing)
