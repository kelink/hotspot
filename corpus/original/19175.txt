(Reuters) - Southeast Asian health ministers will seek to coordinate their fight against swine flu at an emergency meeting in Thailand next week, officials said Thursday.
The meeting of ministers from the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), scheduled for May 7-8, was called after the U.N. health agency warned a pandemic was imminent.
The region has had no reported cases yet of the H1N1 virus, which has killed up to 176 people in Mexico and one toddler in the United States. But after bouts with SARS and bird flu in recent years, the group is taking no chances.
"ASEAN's goal is to tackle the problem in a united way. We did it in the past and we are ready to show that we can do it again," Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva told reporters in Bangkok.
ASEAN has stockpiled 500,000 courses of antiviral drugs in Singapore. Member countries hold another 500,000 courses of the drugs, which have been shown to work against the new virus while pharmaceutical giants work on a vaccine.
Thai Public Health Minister Witthaya Kaewparadai said he had ordered the country's state drugmaker to produce 1 million tablets of the antiviral drug Tamiflu.
"We have to prepare immediately. This matter cannot be delayed," he told reporters.
Pharmaceutical firms in China and India say they can quickly ramp up production of antiviral drugs if swine flu threatens the world's two most populous countries.
