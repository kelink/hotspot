The United States, Britain, France and Germany are expected to ask Russia and China in talks on Sept. 2 to consider a fourth round of U.N. sanctions, possibly targeting Iran's oil sector, if Tehran does not accept negotiations on its nuclear programme.
"If there is no further progress immediately then I believe the world will have to look at stepping up sanctions against Iran as a matter of priority," Brown said at a news conference in London with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The United States and its allies, including Britain, accuse Iran of trying to develop atomic weapons, while Iran says it only wants nuclear technology to generate electricity.
Asked about the prospect of Iran developing nuclear arms, Netanyahu said: "Time is running out, it is late in the day, but it is not too late."
The United Nations Security Council has imposed three sets of sanctions on Iran, in December 2006, March 2007 and March 2008, targeting Iranian companies and individuals linked to the nuclear programme. [ID:nLQ709764]
Relations between Britain and Iran worsened after Iran's June presidential election. Brown accused Iran of "repression and brutality" in crushing protests against the re-election of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called Britain "the most treacherous" of Iran's enemies.
After holding talks with Brown, Netanyahu is due to meet U.S. envoy George Mitchell in London on Wednesday. (Additional reporting by Sylvia Westall and Mark Heinrich in Vienna; Editing by Jon Hemming)
