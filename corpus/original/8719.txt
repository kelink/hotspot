WHAT IS PNEUMONIA?
* Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses and fungi. Its severity can be based on the type of organism causing it. * Signs of pneumonia can include coughing, fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, rapid breathing or shortness of breath, chills, or chest pain.
* When bacteria, viruses or, rarely, fungi living in your nose, mouth, sinuses, or the environment spread to your lungs, you can develop pneumonia or other infections. You can catch the bacteria or viruses from people who are infected with them, whether they are sick or not.
* Pneumonia kills more children under five years of age than any other illness in every region of the world. Of the estimated total of 9 million child deaths in 2007, around 20 percent or 1.8 million, were due to pneumonia.
* Mortality due to childhood pneumonia is strongly linked to malnutrition, poverty and inadequate access to health care. Consequently, more than 98 percent of pneumonia deaths in children occur in 68 countries where progress in reducing under-five mortality is most critical.
-- For the 68 countries, the costs will double over the 6-year period rising from an annual need of $3.8 billion in 2010 to $8.0 billion by 2015.
-- The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) said on Friday [ID:nLU608764] it was seeking it was seeking $4 billion in funds to vaccinate as many as 130 million of the world's poorest children against diarrhoea and pneumonia.
* GLOBAL COSTS FOR SCALING UP GAPP INTERVENTIONS: (breastfeeding, vaccination and case management) in countdown countries, 2010-2015. Figures are in millions of U.S. dollars.
