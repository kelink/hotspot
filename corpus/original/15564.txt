(Reuters) - PSA Peugeot Citroen (
) launched a convertible bond to raise up to 575 million euros ($796.8 million) and still expects a 2009 operating loss, though its European sales will fall less sharply than it feared.
Peugeot Citroen said on Tuesday that while the European car market was still down compared with 2008, the company's "best current estimate" was for a decline of 12 percent in European unit sales instead of the 20 percent previously forecast.
The group forecast a recurring operating loss of between 1 billion and 2 billion euros, citing uncertainties over whether governments would continue supporting the sector next year, and volatile raw material prices and exchange rates.
"One to two billion is in line with market expectations," said Credit Suisse analyst Stuart Pearson.
"Peugeot is not reconsidering its estimate of a maximum cash burn of 4 billion euros for the year, which seems to us to be the main element to take note of at this stage," CM-CIC analysts added in a research note.
At 0920 GMT, Peugeot shares had recovered after opening over 4 percent down, to trade 2.18 percent higher at 19.72 euros, outperforming the DJ Stoxx European autos sector .SXAP, which rose 1.18 percent.
"We were expecting something to strengthen their balance sheets from all the mass makers," Pearson said.
Carmakers need to prepare for the end of scrapping schemes -- whereby drivers get cash incentives for trading in old cars for newer, greener models -- which could make for a tough 2010, Pearson said.
The offering of bonds convertible into new or existing Peugeot Citroen shares is intended to raise between 500 million and 575 million euros. The offer runs from June 23 to 25 and the bonds are due on Jan. 1, 2016.
"The funds ... will provide the general financing needs of the group as well as ... its existing and future development projects in the automobile business," the group said in a statement, not ruling out more bond issues.
For its future plans, it cited the development of the Peugeot 5008 in the second half of this year, engine efficiency and electric motors as well as expansion of sites in countries including Russia and China.
"This does underline for the wider industry that carmakers should expect a tough 2010 and take action now to strengthen their balance sheets," Credit Suisse's Pearson said.
