US coal hopes rise with world steel-maker demand

(Reuters) - Rising Chinese interest in buying U.S. steel-making coal is stirring U.S. markets, trade sources said on Friday.
"They're actually soliciting for qualities available and having samples sent for testing," Frank Kolojeski of New Jersey-based TransGlobal Ventures Corp told Reuters.
"I understand there are people out looking for freight from the U.S. to China. That's a good indication," he said. "
) confirming a sale recently, several ships have been hired to haul U.S. coal to China, Coal & Energy Price Report newsletter said Friday.
Analysts cite demand in China, steel mill restarts and Australian struggles to fill orders for a metallurgical coal price rise to $160 a metric tonne from less than $100 a few months ago.
There is spot price "momentum" toward $175 a tonne, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts Mark Liinamaa and Wes Sconce this week.
Part of the reason for demand pressuring supply is port congestion in Australia, a major supplier to China, where coal can be mined faster than it can be exported, Kolojeski said.
U.S. producers welcome the business, but to compete with Australia they must absorb the additional $40 to $45 cost of a longer haul from North America to China, Coal & Energy said.
The real hope of U.S. miners is for continued tightness in the market coupled with additional demand from Europe and Brazil, Coal & Energy's Jim Thompson said.
The haul from the United States to Europe and Brazil is much shorter and more profitable for U.S. producers, he said.
But the Morgan Stanley analysts said a tighter met coal market could lead to higher prices for U.S. power plant or thermal coal, which is lower grade than met coal.
"Should met coal markets remain tight into 2010 and create demand for marginal U.S. met coal exports, U.S. thermal coal prices could be in for a sharp rebound," they said. (Reporting by Bruce Nichols; Editing by Marguerita Choy)
