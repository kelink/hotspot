(Reuters) - Dutch chemicals group DSM NV (
) reported a 76 percent decline in core first-quarter profit, but said it was seeing no worsening in its markets, and profit at its key Nutrition unit beat estimates. First-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) reached 57 million euros ($75 million), in line with the average forecast of 56 million from a Reuters poll of 10 analysts, and down from last year's 237 million euros. "Although no improvement in demand in end-markets seems to be imminent, we are not at this point in time seeing a further deterioration, either," Chief Executive Feike Sijbesma said in a statement, echoing an earlier statement from peer Akzo Nobel (
On a divisional basis, DSM's Nutrition business reported EBIT of 141 million euros, beating estimates of 111 million, as it benefited from pricing increases for vitamins implemented in 2008.
The company said business conditions at Nutrition were expected to stay relatively favourable this year, but there was still a high degree of uncertainty for demand at its Performance Materials business, especially for engineering plastics and resins.
DSM shares were up 2.7 percent at 22.52 euros at 0827 GMT, compared with a 2.1 percent fall in the DJ Stoxx European chemical index .SX4P.
"Pharma and especially Nutrition showed resilience, and stabilisation is signalled in the other clusters," SNS Securities analyst Danny van Doesburg said in a note.
Sijbesma said DSM expected to exceed by 25 percent its targeted savings of 100 million euros by 2010. Those savings included 1,000 job cuts, which it will also exceed by 25 percent.
The global recession has led to sharp declines in earnings at chemicals companies due to a drop in demand from the car, electrical and construction industries.
Last week, Dutch peer and resins customer Akzo Nobel (
) missed forecasts with a 50 percent fall in core first-quarter profit as volume declines seen at the end of 2008 accelerated, but it said it, too, was seeing signs of stabilisation. [ID:nLN713600]
DSM sales for the quarter were 1.84 billion euros, about 5 percent below the average forecast of 1.93 billion.
But Chief Financial Officer Rolf-Dieter Schwalb told reporters that if economic conditions did not significantly improve, DSM might miss its underlying earnings margin target at Performance Materials and Polymer Intermediates, but that the Nutrition target was likely to be met.
The company also expects to meet its targeted 1 billion euros in additional sales from innovation, but is uncertain of meeting its targeted $1.5 billion in annual sales in China. (Editing by Mike Nesbit/Will Waterman) ($1=.7611 euros)
