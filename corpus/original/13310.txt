) may invest at least $1 billion in a second plant in Malaysia, the Business Times reported on Monday, citing a senior company official.
The firm may partner with new shareholder China Nonferrous Metal Mining Group (CNMC) to build the plant, which will produce niobium metal used to make high grade steel, said Mike Vaisey, Lynas' vice president for technical development.
The plant will take 3-5 years to be developed, including a year for a feasibility study that would start in early 2010.
"CNMC is keen on building the plant and has offered to put in $250 million in debt and a similar amount in equity. CNMC would also guarantee us a loan from a Chinese bank," he said.
Lynas will also restart its $340 million lanthanide processing plant in the central Malaysian state of Pahang, Vaisey said, which was part of the deal with CNMC when the Australian firm had to suspend work and find new funds following a dispute with bondholders.
The deal with CNMC was part of series of Chinese investments in Australia's mining industry as Australian firms turn to China for capital and China seeks to lock in supplies of raw materials.
CNMC in May provided a bank guarantee to enable a Chinese bank to lend Lynas $104 million to help fund the the first phase of Lynas's rare earths project, including this Malaysian plant that will produce 10,500 tonnes yearly of rare earths oxide.
Rare earths are used in energy-saving light bulbs, iPods, glass polishing as well as in automotive catalytic converters. (Reporting by Niluksi Koswanage; Editing by Kim Coghill)
