FOREX-US dollar falls broadly as data spurs growth fears

(Reuters) - The dollar fell broadly on Friday after data showing a wider U.S. trade deficit and weaker consumer sentiment reinforced views that the United States may return to economic health more slowly than other countries.
A brighter outlook abroad, including a report showing the euro zone may have exited recession in the third quarter, boosted the euro and also encouraged investors to buy stocks and commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar.
"There is increasing evidence that the U.S. recovery is much more vulnerable than previously thought, which provides another reason for traders to bail out of U.S. dollars," said Kathy Lien, director of FX research at GFT Forex in New York.

With the U.S. jobless rate above 10 percent and the Federal Reserve signaling it's in no rush to lift interest rates, analysts say investors are increasingly borrowing dollars at low rates to finance trades in assets with higher returns.
The fact that the U.S. trade deficit widened "in an environment when the dollar has been very weak" was concerning, said Jacob Oubina, currency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. "If we can't get the trade deficit lower in such circumstances, it's really not good for growth."
A weak currency usually decreases imports and boosts exports, improving a country's balance of trade position.
Daniel Katzive, currency strategist at Credit Suisse in New York, said the data also suggests that a recovery in the United States is going to "go hand in hand with a larger financing requirement" for the country.
"The United States is going to remain a major importer of capital and that's problematic for the currency when you have very low yields," he added.
Currency markets will also be following U.S. President Barack Obama's first official tour of Asia as speculation grew that this could generate pressure on some countries -- China in particular -- to let their currencies rise.
