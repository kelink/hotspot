), South Korea's second-largest steelmaker, on Wednesday said sales volume would rise 18 percent in the second quarter from the first quarter, driven by solid demand from state infrastructure projects and traders restocking.
"Shipments of construction steel are seen rising slightly as distributor inventories have fallen to low levels and demand from public works is set to rise. But private sector demand is likely to continue to remain depressed," Hyundai said in a statement.
It projected prices for steel plate, used in cars, home appliances and ships, to come under pressure as raw materials prices for 2009/10, which have yet to be fixed, are expected to decline.
Hyundai reported a 62 percent drop in first-quarter net profit to 51.5 billion won ($38.18 million) from a year earlier, as it slowed production rates sharply, increasing per-unit manufacturing costs.
Steelmakers in South Korea, a net steel importer, are faring better than regional rivals because of relatively tight domestic market conditions.
