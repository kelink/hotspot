(Reuters) - Syniverse Holdings Inc SVR.N, a provider of technology services to wireless telecommunications companies, posted a fall in quarterly profit, hurt partly by lower revenue from its technology interoperability and call processing services.
For the full year, the company said it expects revenue to be closer to the lower end of its previous forecast of $460 million to $480 million.
The company, whose customers include AT&T Inc (
), Telefonica (
), earned $16.5 million, or 24 cents a share, for the second quarter, compared with $20.4 million, or 30 cents a share, a year ago.
Syniverse's cash net income was 37 cents a share.
Revenue from its technology interoperability services dropped 17 percent to $66.3 million, while that from its call processing services fell 12 percent.
Analysts were looking for earnings of 36 cents a share, excluding items, on revenue of $116.9 million, according to Reuters Estimates.
