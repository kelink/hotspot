(Reuters) - Poland is home once again to Europe's dirtiest power plant, but German utilities still owned 11 of the 30 most polluting facilities in the European Union in 2008, final EU data showed.
Poland's Belchatow coal plant, run by state-owned utility BOT Elektrownia, spewed the most climate-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) of any EU installation last year, pumping the equivalent of 30.9 million tonnes into the atmosphere.
Belchatow's chief executive was dismissed earlier this month amid an ongoing restructuring of the plant's owner Polska Grupa Energetyczna, a company spokeswoman said. [ID:nL3547606]
It was unclear if this restructuring would affect the plant's emissions.
The "dirty thirty", a term first coined by green group WWF in 2005, belched some 387.8 million tonnes of CO2 in 2008, down 1.9 percent from 2007. Analysts estimate this number will drop further this year as the global economic downturn severely erodes EU industrial production.
Coal-fired power plants made up the bulk of the list, though several steelmakers including ArcelorMittal (
Steelmakers are expected to be largely absent from the list next year as EU steel production figures were down 44 percent year on year in May, according to Barclays Capital.
BarCap analysts forecast EU industrial production will drop by 15 percent in 2009, meaning steelmakers and other industrials will see emissions fall, giving them an even larger surplus in EU Emissions Trading Scheme carbon permits than they had in 2008.
Only eight installations in the top 30 opted to export emissions cuts to poorer nations under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism in 2008, the data showed.
Seven power plants in Germany, Italy and Poland and a U.S. Steel plant in Slovakia imported 9.3 million Certified Emissions Reduction (CER) offsets, issued by the United Nations to clean energy projects in countries like India and China.
Below is a list of the EU's "dirty thirty" that includes CO2 emissions figures for 2007 and 2008 in millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, as well as percentage change.
