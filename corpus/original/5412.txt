China rate rises no panacea to curb inflation: adviser

(Reuters) - China should not solely rely on interest rate rises to curb inflation, an academic adviser to the People's Bank of China said in remarks published on Thursday.
Zhou Qiren, who is also a professor at Peking University, said the government must take steps to tackle supply-side strains that have been a key factor pushing up consumer prices.
Loose monetary policy in 2009 has created excessive liquidity and helped fuel prices of various products, he said.
"Much liquidity and fewer goods is the reason behind inflation. Raising interest rates cannot change such a situation," he was quoted by the China Securities Journal as saying.
Zhou warned that liquidity had been channeled from the real estate market to other sectors of the economy, after Beijing took measures to prevent a property bubble.
China's annual inflation hit a 25-month high of 4.4 percent in October, fuelling expectations of further tightening measures.
The PBOC has ramped up its efforts to tighten monetary conditions in the past month, increasing bank reserve requirements and surprising markets on Oct 19 by announcing the first rate rise in nearly three years.
Separately, Zhou was quoted by state media as saying that a stronger yuan could encourage Chinese residents to spend more overseas.
"The yuan exchange rate regime against the U.S. dollar is not flexible enough, and we need to appreciate yuan properly to reduce the cost of buying foreign exchange," he said.
