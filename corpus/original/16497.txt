* Petroceltic's co-venturer farms out 21.03 pct (Adds details)
The company farmed out the interest to PetroAsian Energy (Tunisia) Ltd, a unit of Hong Kong-listed PetroAsian Energy Holdings Ltd (
), formerly known as China Oil Resources Holdings Ltd.
"The overall capital commitment to the seismic and drilling work programme from PetroAsian is up to $14.5 million," Petroceltic said.
PetroAsian will pay all the costs of drilling and testing the two new exploration wells, and the acquisition and processing of new seismic data, the company added.
Petroceltic's co-venturer in the permit, Independent Resources Plc (
