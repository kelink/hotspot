) said on Thursday it was still involved in the multi-billion dollar development of a major Iranian gas field, a day after Tehran announced it had replaced the French oil company with China's CNPC.
"We are still involved in this project and especially in the major project of South Pars 11, combined with the liquefied natural gas (LNG) train," Jean-Jacques Mosconi, head of strategy and planning at Total, told the Reuters Energy Summit.
On Wednesday, the official Iranian news agency IRNA said Tehran had signed a $4.7 billion contract with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) to develop phase 11 of South Pars, replacing Total which it had accused of delays.
Mosconi said Total, the world's fourth largest listed oil company, would remain operator in the field, part of the world's largest reservoir of gas.
"We are not used to entering a major project without remaining a key operator. Our role cannot change in a deep way and we will remain a key operator of the project, so this means having a key stake in the project," he said.
Total has a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Iran's oil company NIOC to develop Phase 11 but the project was overshadowed by haggling over contract terms.
The South Pars reservoir is shared by Iran and Qatar. The Iranian part is divided in 24 phases. (Reporting by Marie Maitre, Muriel Boselli and Benjamin Mallet; Editing by Dan Lalor)
