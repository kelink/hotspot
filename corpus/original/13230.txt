"On the advertising business front, advertisers have begun to deploy their budgets in response to signs of economic recovery in China and increasingly look toward internet media as a cost-effective alternative to advertising in traditional media," Chief Marketing Officer, Belinda Wang said in a statement. The company posted second-quarter profit of $30.9 million, or 79 cents per share, beating analysts expectation by 7 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.
Total revenue for the quarter was $127.1 million. Online game revenue jumped 39 percent to $66.6 million, while brand advertising revenue rose 5 percent to $43.6 million.
Sohu said the 6 percent rise in average revenue per user (ARPU) for Changyou's massively multiplayer online role-playing games were in a range that was "relatively affordable" for the majority of Chinese game players.
Sohu, which vies with the likes of Shanda SNDA.O and Sina.com (
) for the Chinese Internet market, said it expects third-quarter adjusted earnings of 92 cents to 97 cents a share on revenue of $133.5 million to $137.5 million.
Shares of the company were trading up about 2 percent at $64.90 in trading before the bell, after closing at $63.63 Friday on Nasdaq. (Reporting by Savio D'Souza in Bangalore)
