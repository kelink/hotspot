Sony Ericsson sees mobile market recovery

(Reuters) - Sony Ericsson Chief Executive Hideki Komiyama told Reuters in an interview that he expected the global mobile phone market to grow from Q3 or Q4 2009, but it was "hard to say" whether his company needed extra funds.
"It's difficult to say definitively (whether the market has bottomed) but I can see the trend," he said on Friday. "There is probably signs of improvement," he added, pointing to declining inventory and signs that more production would be required.
"I can see the recovery will start mid-Q3 to Q4. Then we might have a fair chance to see this start growing," Komiyama said, adding that he expected the global handset market to decline by 10 percent or more this year.
Komiyama stuck by his forecasts that the first half of 2009 would mark the bottom of a decline at Sony Ericsson, which in April posted a first-quarter loss of 370 million euros ($517.7 million).
"We see the bottom and now we are on the way to recovery," he said, adding that some markets such as Brazil, Russia and Mexico were still suffering.
"At this moment we don't need it," referring to a strong cash position. "I don't know if we will need it or not," he said, referring to funding needs later in the year.
Last month Sony Ericsson said it planned to cut one in five jobs. Cost cutting would continue, Komiyama said on Friday, but the company would invest too, he said, using the example of the Chinese market.
"I can see that 3G is going to explode in the next two years in China. In this case China will require a new phone system for 3G ... and for that we a need special investment or we'll be out of the China market."
