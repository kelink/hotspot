Czechs expect to sell most CO2 rights in '09

(Reuters) - The Czech Republic expects to sell most of its 100 million metric tons of surplus greenhouse gas emissions rights this year to European Union governments and private companies, a government official said on Friday.
But sales of sovereign pollution credits under the Kyoto Protocol climate pact are back on the table as the market recovers, said Pavel Zamyslicky, head of the Environment Ministry's climate change department.
"(The progress of) bilateral talks indicates that we could sell almost the whole surplus by the end of this year," Zamyslicky told Reuters in a telephone interview.
"We expect to finalize talks with Spain and Austria," Zamyslicky said. "We (also) expect that there could be an agreement with one or two private companies from Japan."
None of the potential buyers is willing to purchase an amount close to that seen in the Japan deal, Zamyslicky said, adding the volumes in talks swing around 5 to 10 million metric tons, and sometimes less, per prospective buyer.
Prague has been also in talks with the World Bank, Portugal and Belgium on selling them a portion of so-called Assigned Amount Units (AAUs), which can be used by governments to meet emissions targets under Kyoto.
Critics call AAUs "hot air", arguing that most were generated through restructuring in eastern Europe in the 1990s, when polluting industries in ex-communist countries were shutting anyway, rather than by new investment in clean energy.
Governments can also use United Nations-approved Certified Emissions Reduction (CER) offsets, which are generated by clean energy projects in emerging countries like China and India.
CERs, the benchmark for AAU pricing, have recovered in price to trade around 13 euros on Friday after bottoming at 7.15 euros in February. They are still well below a record peak of 23.88 euros hit a year ago.
