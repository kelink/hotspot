China's Huawei bids for Sprint equipment deal: report

(Reuters) - China's Huawei Technologies is bidding to sell equipment for the expansion of the wireless broadband network of U.S. mobile operator Sprint Nextel (
), the Financial Times cited sources as saying late on Thursday.
The deal will require at least an informal nod from the U.S. government and represents Huawei's HWT.UL first serious foray into the country since the world's second-largest mobile gear maker was forced in 2008 to abandon a joint $2.2 billion bid for network supplier 3Com Corp over security concerns, the paper said.
Huawei officials declined to comment on the FT report, which cited sources close to the matter.
"As part of our ongoing business in the U.S., we always bid for contracts," a Huawei spokesman told Reuters.
If approved, it would be the first time the Shenzhen-based Huawei, founded by Ren Zhengfei, a former engineer with the People's Liberation Army, has sold equipment to a large U.S. telecommunications operator, though it has made sales to smaller U.S. operators.
Huawei's growth in the United States has been stunted by the U.S. government's skepticism about the company, which Washington fears could be used by the Chinese military for economic espionage on the U.S. communications network.
