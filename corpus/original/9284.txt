(Reuters) - Trina Solar Ltd (
) said on Thursday that it landed a sales deal with solar distributor PROINSO for 108 megawatts worth of panels, in a bid to boost the Chinese panel maker's market share in Europe.
Shipments will start in the fourth quarter of 2009 and continue through the first half of 2010, the company said. The panels are expected to power up projects in Europe, including Italy and Spain.
Based in Changzhou, China, Trina Solar makes silicon-based panels and, like other solar companies, it has been hit by falling panel prices amid the financial crisis and global oversupply.
The deal will "allow us to further increase market share in established markets across Europe," Ben Hill, Trina Solar's vice president of sales and marketing for Europe, said in a statement.
Shares of Trina were up 15 cents at $35.50 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Laura Isensee, editing by Dave Zimmerman)
