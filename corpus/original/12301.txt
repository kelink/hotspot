(Reuters) - Copper prices eased back from 10-month highs on Monday, as recent enthusiasm about economic recovery and demand prospects faded in the face of a firmer dollar and worries about weak underlying fundamentals.
Copper for September delivery HGU9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division fell 1.50 cents to close at $2.7705 a lb, pulling back from a session peak at $2.8465, its loftiest level since October 1.
On the London Metal Exchange (LME), three-month copper MCU3 shed $15 to finish at $6,135 a tonne, also retreating from a new 10-month peak at $6,258.
Improved economic sentiment received a boost last week from upbeat manufacturing figures from the United States and China, and surprisingly strong U.S. employment data that indicated that the recession was nearing an end. [ID:nL3653303] [ID:nN07385157]
"The focus seems to be on recovery," said Michael Gross, futures analyst with Optionsellers.com in Tampa, Florida. "A lot of this is about sentiment right now, and the mood of the market wants to believe that things are getting better."
Calyon analyst Robin Bhar cited the recent price strength purely on investment money flows, nothing else.
"The fundamentals haven't changed. In fact, stocks have risen sharply ... underlying demand, if you listen to people in the real world and producers, is nonexistent," he said.
Attention was now on economic data from China, the world's top industrial metals consumer, due on Tuesday and expected to confirm stronger growth. [ID:nBJC000431] [ID:nSP425305]
"If we get even slightly positive numbers this week from China, this market could easily have another leg higher," Optionsellers.com's Gross said.

"From here, further sharp gains in the price of aluminum will be limited by capacity restarts, particularly in China and Russia, and the sale of aluminum stocks held in China," Citigroup said in a note.
Stainless steel ingredient nickel MNI3 hit an 11-month high of $20,475 a tonne, before closing at $20,200 a tonne from $19,625 on Friday.
Nickel has been boosted by signs of restocking by stainless steel mills, which account for about two-thirds of global nickel demand estimated at around 1.2 million tonnes this year.
The focus in the tin market was on the dominant position holder which has bought tin for delivery in September and sold it for December. The premium for the September contract stands at around $400 compared with $1,000 on July 31. [ID:nL7149027]
Three-month tin MSN3 ended unchanged at $14,750 a tonne, lead MPB3 at $1,874 from $1,900 and zinc MZN3 closed at $1,850 from $1,899.
