(Reuters) - The United States remains open to the idea of direct dialogue with North Korea within a six-way framework, a top envoy said Tuesday.
Stephen Bosworth, special representative for North Korea policy, also said that while a threatened second nuclear test by Pyongyang was a step in the wrong direction, there was no sense of crisis regarding the six-party nuclear disarmament talks.
"It is clearly understood the possibility of a direct dialogue between the U.S. and DPRK (North Korea) is very much with us," Bosworth told reporters in Tokyo as he wrapped up his visits to China, South Korea and Japan.
Bosworth said he confirmed the common interest in moving forward with officials from Beijing, Seoul and Tokyo. A U.S. envoy, Sung Kim, will now travel further to Moscow, he added.
"I think everyone is relatively relaxed about where we are at this point of the process. There is not a sense of crisis," Bosworth said.
"Now we are going to proceed with patience and perseverance. We are committed to dialogue and we are obviously interested in returning to a negotiating table as soon as we can," he said.
