(Reuters) - China on Tuesday called on Papua New Guinea to protect Chinese citizens and businesses, which had been victimised by a wave of lootings in recent days.
Looters have attacked Chinese businesses since last Wednesday, as a wave of anti-Chinese sentiment spread across the South Pacific island nation where China has invested in a major nickel mine.
An anti-Asian immigration march in the capital Port Moresby last week sparked the rioting, with many Papua New Guineans blaming the Chinese for their poor standard of living and unfair business practices, said local newspapers. [ID:nSYD472356]
"The Chinese government pays great attention to the safety of Chinese-invested firms and of Chinese people in Papua New Guinea," Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu told a regular news briefing.
He said that while a few Chinese shops had been robbed, nobody had been injured.
"We have already made representations with the Papua New Guinea government, asking them to immediately send police and increase their protection of Chinese business and people, as well as severly punish those responsible and ensure there is no repetition," Ma added.
"The situation is highly unpredictable," it said.
A mountainous nation of some 6 million people north of Australia, Papua New Guinea is rich in a variety of minerals and other resources but has significant crime problems.
Last week, construction of a $1.7 billion nickel mine and processing plant was temporarily stopped after a fight between about 70 Papua New Guinean and Chinese workers. [ID:nSYD391382]
