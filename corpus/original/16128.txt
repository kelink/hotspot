(Reuters) - Twice former champion Maria Sharapova survived a second set blip to reach the semi-finals of the Edgbaston Classic with a 6-1 2-6 6-3 win over Belgium's Yanina Wickmayer on Friday.
After splitting the opening two sets, the Russian re-asserted her authority set up a last four meeting with China's Li Na.
"In the second set I was up a break at 1-0, after that I just kind of lost the momentum and started making more errors than I would have liked and she gained confidence from that," Sharapova told reporters.
"We've always had pretty difficult encounters and I just played her last week at the French Open and it was three tough sets, but that was on clay, and this is a new tournament and a different surface."
India's Sania Mirza will meet Magdalena Rybarikova of Slovakia in the other semi.
"I struggled a little on the clay season, so it's great to be finally on the grass as I always play well on it," said Mirza.
"I was just trying to play my game as much as possible today and be aggressive. It's been a great week so far and a great tune-up for Wimbledon."
