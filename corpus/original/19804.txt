Obama climate chief: U.S. law vital to global deal

(Reuters) - President Barack Obama's top climate negotiator warned on Wednesday that international efforts to tackle global warming are doomed unless the United States enacts laws to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
"There will be no new global deal if the United States is not part of it and we won't be part of it unless we are on track in enacting our own domestic plan," Todd Stern told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
"Unless we stand and deliver by enacting strong, mandatory nationwide climate and energy legislation, the effort to negotiate a new international agreement will come up short," Stern said.
He said the Obama administration in the next few days will unveil a series of proposals to be discussed in Copenhagen. An April 24 deadline for those plans can only be extended "by a little bit," he said.
Democrats who control both chambers of Congress will have a tougher time passing a climate control bill in the Senate, however, where a small band of opponents can use procedural roadblocks to stop legislation.
Opponents, including many Republicans, say imposing new greenhouse controls on U.S. companies would prompt them to move factories and jobs overseas, especially to developing countries such as China and India.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry said China lately has been "moving more rapidly than the United States" and could exceed Beijing's short-term goals for a 20 percent reduction in "energy intensity."
Long-term, such progress could help China build a competitive edge in developing next-generation batteries and electric cars, Kerry said.
Energy intensity is a measure of carbon emissions related to the size of a country's overall economy. While a country's absolute carbon emissions might rise, governments might try to show they have made environmental progress by citing a decrease in emissions relative to the size of their growing economies.
