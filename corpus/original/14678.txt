(Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers disagreed on Monday over whether they should have a single representation at international financial institutions, despite being increasingly willing to speak with one voice.
Jean-Claude Juncker, who chairs the Eurogroup of finance ministers from the 16 countries using the single currency, said the ministers had discussed calls for single-seat representation but failed to reach any agreement at a meeting in Brussels.
"This proposal did not give rise to a round of applause," Juncker told a news conference. "It is a discussion we shall come back to in coming months."
Euro zone member states face pressure to lower their representation at the IMF to make more room for China and other emerging economies, which are playing an increasingly important role in financing the Fund.
EU states are also reluctant to abandon their national seats at the IMF board and other forums such as the Group of Seven industrial countries, which includes euro zone members France, Germany and Italy, as well as EU member Britain.
"Everyone agrees for the long term this is the best solution but some think the long term is always very far away," he said.
"We need to work on this ... but a single seat for the euro zone is not a project today that is either realistic or mature," she said.
Barroso, who heads the EU's executive, made clear there was no consensus on the issue in the EU as a whole.
"Are they ready for a single representation of the European Union? Honestly I don't think so," he told a news conference before this week's summit of the Group of Eight major powers.
"Are they ready to have more coherent representation in those fora? I think probably yes," he said. (Additional reporting by Tamora Vidaillet and Bate Felix; Writing by Timothy Heritage; Editing by Dale Hudson)
