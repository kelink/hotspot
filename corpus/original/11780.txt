FACTBOX: China-Australia ties span business, people

(Reuters) - China has canceled a senior minister's planned visit to Australia over Canberra's granting of a visa for exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer.
The cancellation comes at a time of diplomatic strains over China's arrest of four employees of Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto.
* Australia established diplomatic ties with Beijing in 1972, adopting a One China policy that has underpinned relations since. Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is a fluent Mandarin speaker and a former diplomat who served in Beijing.
* Both countries have strong cultural links. Former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke allowed 42,000 Chinese students to stay after the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests in 1989. China is Australia's fourth largest source of migrants and over 100,000 Chinese students study in the country. Australia's China-born population rose eightfold between 1981 and 2006, hitting 203,000.
* Bilateral ties have benefited from frequent high-level visits. Rudd visited China in April 2008 and again in August 2008 for the Olympics, following on from visits to Australia by President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao.
* Politically, an Australia-China Strategic Dialogue began in 2008, while Australia and China hold closed-door human rights talks annually, agreeing to keep any issues private.
* China is Australia's biggest export market, with two-way trade worth $53 billion last year. Major Australian exports in 2008 included iron ore, wool, copper ore and manganese. Canberra imports mostly clothing, communications equipment, computers, toys and sporting goods.
* Australia is China's 15th biggest export market and 6th largest source of imports, worth just 3.2 percent of the country's total.
* Resource-hungry Chinese firms have been behind several tie-ups with Australia firms, the latest being a $2.9 billion bid by state-owned Yanzhou Coal Mining Co to buy coal miner Felix Resources Ltd. But a planned $19.5 billion investment by metals firm Chinalco in Anglo-Australian miner Rio failed when Rio sought an alternative rights issue and joint venture with fellow mining giant BHP.
