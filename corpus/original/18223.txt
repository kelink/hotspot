(Reuters) - Spanish wind turbine manufacturer Gamesa (
) posted a 22 percent rise in core earnings in the first quarter on Thursday, underpinned by improved margins and cost cutting.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose to 105 million euros ($142.3 million) from 86 million, the company said.
Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) rose to 53 million euros from 39 million, while net profit fell to 32 million euros from 36 million a year ago.
The net figure is not comparable however due to accounting changes following the sale of Gamesa's wind farm business in 2008.
The company is also keeping to its wind power sales target of between 3,300 and 3,600 megawatts for the full year, after selling 814 in the first quarter.
"Demand is not as strong as in previous years ... We are taking steps to adjust output to demand," Gamesa's managing director for control and management Inigo Gimenez said during a conference call.
Gamesa shares closed up 4.47 percent at 14.48 euros, while the blue chip IBEX-35 fell 0.18 percent.
"Our perception is that we should see some sort of recovery in both of these markets from the second half of this year," and we are positive for 2010, Gimenez said.
"We are prepared for the recovery but the rhythm of this will not depend on us but on the liquidity for projects," he said. ($1=.7377 Euro) (Reporting by Judy MacInnes with additional reporting by Clara Vilar; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
