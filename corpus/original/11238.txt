(Reuters) - Tobacco could kill one billion people this century if current trends hold, global health experts said in a report issued on Tuesday.
* Tobacco use costs the global economy $500 billion a year in direct medical expenses, lost productivity and environmental harm.
* Tobacco takes the place of potential food production on almost 9.9 million acres (4 million hectares) of the planet's agricultural land, equal to the world's orange groves or banana plantations.
* Tobacco use will kill 6 million people in 2010 from cancer, heart disease, emphysema and other diseases.
* Occupational exposure to secondhand smoke kills 200,000 workers every year.
* Tobacco use will eventually kill 250 million of today's teenagers and children.
* 50 million Chinese children, mostly boys, will die prematurely from tobacco-related diseases.
WHO SMOKES?
* Smoking rates among women are either stable or increasing in several southern, central and eastern European countries.
* Nearly 60 percent of Chinese men smoke and China consumes more than 37 percent of the world's cigarettes.
