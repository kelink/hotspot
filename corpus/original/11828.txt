(Reuters) - U.S. Treasury debt prices climbed on Monday, with the 30-year bond up over a point as stocks fell sharply, shoring up the safe-haven appeal of government debt.
"The Treasury market is pretty much looking at the stock market, which is down pretty substantially not just here but overseas -- that is giving a bid to Treasuries," said Jay Mueller, senior portfolio manager with Wells Capital Management in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
The benchmark 10-year note US10YT=RR was trading 24/32 higher in price for a yield of 3.49 percent, down from 3.58 percent late on Friday. Yields fell as far as 3.47 percent on Monday, the lowest in nearly a month.
"Markets, which had acted with exuberance at the prospect that much of the economic collapse had ended, are apparently making a more sober assessment of the reality of the recovery that is evolving," said T.J. Marta, market strategist with Marta on the Markets in Scotch Plains, New Jersey.
Bonds briefly pared gains after the New York Federal Reserve's "Empire State" general business conditions index for August rose by much more than expected, with the gauge of the manufacturing sector showing growth for the first time since April 2008. [ID:nN17371906]
"The Fed survey was stronger than expected, which corroborates the idea that manufacturing is rebounding. It's the highest reading since November 2007, which underscores the rebound, and also the depths it had fallen," said Dan Greenhaus, analyst with Miller Tabak & Co in New York.
"The big story remains that after the near-term bounce, how will it fare after the impact of the stimulus goes away?"
The market had little reaction to data showing net overall capital outflows from the U.S. fell to $31.2 billion in June from May's $65.7 billion outflow. China cut its U.S. Treasury holdings while Japan increased its holdings. [ID:nN17370347]
Two-year notes US2YT=RR were trading 3/32 higher in price for a yield of 1.02 percent, down from 1.07 percent late on Friday, while the 30-year bond US30YT=RR was 1-13/32 higher for a yield of 4.34 percent from 4.43 percent.
The Federal Reserve bought $7.016 billion of Treasuries, making most of its purchases in debt maturing in five years, offering some further support for government debt prices.
According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch Fixed Income Indexes, last week was the best week for U.S. Treasuries since the week before Christmas, with a total return of 1.47 percent on the Treasury Master Index.
Among benchmark issues, 10-year notes delivered a total return of 2.52 percent on the week, again the best since late December. Two-year notes returned 0.51 percent on the week, their best showing since last fall. (Additional reporting by John Parry and Ryan Vlastelica; Editing by James Dalgleish)
