The Amu Darya project, which is expected to commence operation by the end of 2009, is an offshore natural gas project cooperation between CNPC and the government of Turkmenistan on a product sharing basis.
In addition, PetroChina said it would buy South Oil Exploration and Development, which explores oil and gas in Guangdong, Hainan and Guangxi, from an indirectly owned subsidary and CNPC for 2.81 billion yuan (US$411.4 million).

It also aims to raise annual refining capacity to 200 million tonnes per year within seven to eight years in its bid for 40 percent of its home market. [ID:nHKG185204] (US$1=HK$7.75=6.830 yuan) (Reporting by Donny Kwok; editing by Sanjeev Miglani)
