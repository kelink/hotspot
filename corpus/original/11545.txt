CORRECTED - US STOCKS-Futures rise after China rally; jobless claims due

(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures edged higher on Thursday following a rally in Chinese equities and ahead of data expected to show a dip in jobless claims after a surprise increase in the prior period.
A 20 percent fall in Chinese equities over the last two weeks sparked a wave of selling in global markets on fears that prices were too far ahead of the recovery. China's benchmark index
gained 4.5 percent on Thursday, easing some of those fears.
"There are a lot of companies who carefully watch Chinese growth, particularly in the commodities sector. So it has a big impact on how people view stock valuation," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.
Meckler cautioned, however, that volumes remained light because of the summer season, suggesting trading did not reflect decisions by big-money players.
S&P 500 futures SPc1 rose 3.5 points, and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 gained 11 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures NDc1 were up 1.25 points.
The consensus of economists is for initial weekly jobless claims to fall slightly to 550,000, a decline of 8,000 from the previous week, when they posted a surprise rise. It was the first upward move in seven weeks as the labor market struggled to stabilize. The data is due at 8:30 a.m. (12:30 GMT).
