Santander Brasil IPO debuts with a whimper

(Reuters) - Brazil's biggest ever initial public offering kicked off with a whimper instead of a bang as shares of the Brazilian unit of Spanish bank Santander edged lower in their trading debut.
Executives of Santander Brasil sought to focus on the fact that it raised 14.1 billion reais ($8.05 billion) with its IPO in Sao Paulo and New York, the largest ever in Brazil and the biggest in the world since March 2008.
"The timing could not have been better," Fabio Barbosa, Santander's chief executive for Brazil, said at a news conference with executives from the Sao Paulo stock exchange, citing signs of recovery in the Brazilian economy.
The shares came under pressure because of both the size of the offering and the price, which put Santander Brasil's valuation higher than some Brazilian rivals, traders said.
New York-traded shares of the bank, formally known as Banco Santander (Brasil) SA, were down 1.07 percent at $13.26.
Brazil's economy, the largest in Latin America, has emerged from a six-month recession and is expected to expand as much as 5 percent in 2010, which should boost demand for consumer finance and corporate loans.
Santander Brasil had filed to sell 525 million units, with each unit representing 55 common shares and 50 preferred shares. The offering was increased by 75 million units to meet strong demand from investors.
The IPO will add 1.43 billion euros in capital gains for the bank's Spanish parent, Santander said in Madrid [ID:nL7560166].
The bank priced its IPO on Tuesday at 23.5 reais, while its U.S.-traded shares priced at $13.50.
The IPO was the largest ever for a Brazilian company, dwarfing the offering by credit card processor VisaNet in June, and was the biggest in the world since Visa Inc's offering in March 2008.
The IPO also surpassed the IPO by China State Construction Engineering Corp, which raised $7.3 billion in July. ($1=1.762 reais) (Writing by Elzio Barreto; Editing by Todd Benson and John Wallace)
