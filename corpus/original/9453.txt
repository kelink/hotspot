The European Medicines Agency has approved three H1N1 vaccines -- GlaxoSmithKline's (
) Pandemrix, Novartis's (
) Focetria and Baxter International's (
There have been a total of 230 deaths linked to H1N1 in Europe since April, with nearly half of them occurring in Britain, according to the Stockholm-based European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
Outside Europe, vaccination programmes are also underway in various countries, including the United States, China and Australia.
Nationwide vaccination programme launched on Oct. 21, starting with front-line health workers and hospital patients deemed to be at high risk. Family doctors will start immunising patients in priority groups from Oct. 26.
Regional states will start a programme of vaccination on Oct. 26. The initial focus will be on healthcare workers, police and fire-fighters, plus people in at-risk groups and pregnant women.
H1N1 vaccines still need to be approved by the country's own regulatory agency and immunisation is not expected to start until around the end of this month or the start of November.
