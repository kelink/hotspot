(Reuters) - Containers piled up at Greece's Piraeus port (OLP) (
) on Friday, the ninth day of a strike by dockworkers pushing the new government to revise a concession deal with China's Cosco Pacific (
Thousands of containers clogged the docks of Piraeus, while ships with tonnes of merchandise on board were turning to alternative ports, the Piraeus Merchants' Association said.
The dockworkers strike began on Oct. 1, the day Cosco Pacific took over management of two of Piraeus' piers. The world's fifth-largest port operator signed a 3.4 billion euro ($5.02 billion) deal a year ago to upgrade and manage the piers for 35 years.
"We won't let Cosco enter the port, because we believe the contract is hurting employees' rights and the country's interests, and we are determined to continue until our problem is solved," George Nouhoutides, head of the dockworkers' union said.
"We call the new government, which supported us when it was in opposition, to stand by us," Nouhoutides told Reuters.
Greece's Socialists, who won Sunday's national election, have promised to review the deal, which workers say affects employment rights and may lead to job cuts. The case is also being examined by a top court.
OLP, which is 74 percent state-owned, said this week that such protests not only hurt the company's profitability but also its credibility and urged dockworkers to end their action.
OLP's shares were up 1.74 percent in early trading at the Athens Stock Exchange on Friday. They have gained about 42 percent since the start of the year, underperforming a 53 percent rise in the benchmark index .ATG.
