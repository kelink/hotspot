Wintek also makes touchscreens for Apple's popular iPhone.
Some workers at Wintek's factory in the city of Dongguan in the heart of the Pearl River Delta went on strike last week over pay, the spokesman said.
"I can't say for sure how many people took part in the strike, but work has since resumed and our production won't be affected," James Chen told Reuters, adding that the facility employs between 6,000 and 7,000 workers.
The case is the latest one of labour unrest at a factory in southern China's crowded coastal cities, where many companies have had to grapple with rising costs in recent years as more firms move into the area and living standards rise.
Wintek shares rose by their 7 percent daily maximum limit on Tuesday, outpacing the benchmark TAIEX
share index's 1.73 percent climb.
