(Reuters) - Lazard Ltd (
) reported higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, helped by strength in its restructuring business, and increased its dividend, sending its shares up 10.2 percent.
Still, profit was lower than a year earlier as Lazard's mergers and acquisitions business had not fully recovered in a lackluster market.
Lazard Vice Chairman Steven Golub told Reuters he expected a "gradual rebound" in the M&A market, but was optimistic about the gains in restructuring.
"It is a great business for us," Golub said, adding that Lazard is advising on more than 100 restructuring assignments worldwide.
Net income attributable to Lazard shareholders fell to $43.1 million, or 34 cents per share, from $64.6 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier.
The results were well above the analysts' average expectation of 13 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.
But with confidence that business is improving, Golub said Lazard increased its quarterly dividend by 25 percent to 12.5 cents per share.
Operating revenue fell 40 percent in the M&A business to $134.9 million. Still, that business showed signs it was bouncing back from the first quarter, when it booked operating revenue of $96.4 million.
Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst David Trone called this a "strong rebound." In a research note, he said the first-quarter M&A results appeared to be an "anomaly."
Wasserstein said he was encouraged by the growing number of advising opportunities in a list of countries including China, India, Brazil, Australia, and Russia.
"The advisory business at Lazard is now much broader than M&A," Wasserstein said.
Assets under management rose to $98 billion from $81 billion in the first quarter because of strong net inflows, but were still down from year-earlier levels of $134 billion.
Shares of Lazard were up 10.2 percent at $33.68 in New York Stock Exchange trade. The stock has risen 13 percent so far this year, but still down from a 52-week high of $50.00 set on Sept 19. (Reporting by Steve Eder and Juan Lagorio; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Jeffrey Benkoe)
