(Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan exchanged views on U.S.-China economic relations and the global economy during a meeting in Beijing on Thursday, the U.S. Treasury Department said.
The brief statement made no reference to U.S. concerns over China's currency practices that have strained relations between the two countries.
Thursday's meeting came amid speculation that Beijing might soon unveil a long-awaited shift in strategy by revaluing its currency, the yuan.
Many U.S. lawmakers say China's currency is undervalued by as much as 40 percent against the dollar, giving Chinese exporters an unfair trade advantage.
Geithner's brief stop in Beijing came at the end of a trip to India.
