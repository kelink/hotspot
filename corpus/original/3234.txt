(Reuters) - China's Sinopec (

The deals mark the latest push in Australia to increase its share of a growing global appetite for liquefied natural gas (lng), a form of gas converted temporarily into a liquid to make it easier to ship and store.
Australia's resources ministry last week predicted Australia will overtake Qatar as the world's top supplier of lng early in the second half of this decade as new projects are developed.

The deal would finalise the marketing of the second phase, or train, of the project, Origin Energy said.
"To that end, we are well placed to make a final investment decision on the second train in early 2012," Origin Energy chairman Kevin McCann said in a statement.
Origin Energy has approved the first phase of the estimated A$20 billion two-train LNG joint along with ConocoPhillips, but no decision has been made on when a second train would be activated.
Australia Pacific LNG and Sinopec in April reached a sales agreement covering the sale of 4.3 million tonnes of LNG for 20 years starting in mid-2015. At the time, Sinopec subscribed for a 15 percent equity interest in Australia Pacific LNG.
The first train was sanctioned by the partners in July 2011, followed by a heads of agreement with Japan's Kansai Electric Power Co (
Last week, Japan's Inpex Corp (
) signed around $70 billion worth of LNG sales and equity agreements from its Ichthys project in Australia, laying foundations for a final investment decision on the project early next year.
In that deal, Five Japanese utilities, Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO) (
), Tokyo Gas (
), Osaka Gas (
), Kyushu Electric (
), and Kansai Electric will buy a total of 4 million tonnes per year of LNG for 15 years.
