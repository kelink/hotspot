(Reuters) - U.S. Treasury debt prices climbed on Monday, with the 30-year bond up over a full point as stocks fell sharply and shored up the safe-haven appeal of government debt.
"The Treasury market is pretty much looking at the stock market, which is down pretty substantially not just here but overseas -- that is giving a bid to Treasuries," said Jay Mueller, senior portfolio manager with Wells Capital Management in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
The benchmark 10-year note US10YT=RR was trading 22/32 higher in price for a yield of 3.49 percent, down from 3.57 percent late on Friday. Yields reached to as low as 3.47 percent on Monday, the lowest in nearly a month.
"The equities market is under pressure and giving (Treasuries) a safe-haven bid," said David Coard, head of fixed-income sales and trading at The Williams Capital Group in New York.
Bonds briefly pared gains after the New York Federal Reserve's "Empire State" general business conditions index for August rose by much more than expected, with the gauge of the manufacturing sector showing growth for the first time since April 2008. [ID:nN17371906]
"The Fed survey was stronger than expected, which corroborates the idea that manufacturing is rebounding. Its the highest reading since November 2007, which underscores the rebound, and also the depths it had fallen," said Dan Greenhaus, analyst with Miller Tabak & Co, in New YorK.
"The big story remains that after the near-term bounce, how will it fare after the impact of the stimulus goes away?"
The market had little reaction to data showing net overall capital outflows from the U.S. fell to $31.2 billion in June from the prior month's $65.7 billion outflow. China also decreased their U.S. Treasury holdings during the month, while Japan increased their holdings. [ID:nN17370347]
Two-year notes US2YT=RR were trading 2/32 higher in price for a yield of 1.03 percent, down from 1.07 percent late on Friday, while the 30-year bond US30YT=RR was 1-3/32 higher for a yield of 4.36 percent from 4.43 percent.
According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch Fixed Income Indexes, last week was the best week for U.S. Treasuries since the week before Christmas, with a total return of 1.47 percent on the Treasury Master Index.
Among the benchmark issues, 10-year notes delivered a total return of 2.52 percent on the week, again the best since late December. Meanwhile, two-year notes returned 0.51 percent on the week, their best showing since last fall.
