LMEWEEK-Ernst & Young sees return to individual mine IPOs

(Reuters) - High debt levels and a lack of financing may lead to the return of initial public offerings (IPOs) for individual mines, said Tim Williams, director of mining and metals at accountancy firm Ernst and Young.
"In 2007 and 2008 these guys just completely blew their brains out. They borrowed staggering amounts of money from the banks and used that money for buying each other," he told Reuters in an interview.
The banks now want their money back and mining companies do not have enough cash to build new mines to help meet growing demand from developing countries: Brazil, China and India.
"I don't know where the money to build new large mines will come from. One option is to return to listing individual mines, which is what they used to do until this model of financing fell away in the late 1980s/1990s."
BHP Billiton's (
) Olympic Dam project, which is estimated to cost about $15 billion to expand, could be a potential IPO, he said.
"You have to pay big, fat juicy dividends which is one of the reasons why investors like mine IPOs."
The market for listing mining companies has dried up over the last 18 months, but Williams said this could pick up in the second half of 2010.
"There are lots of big IPOs waiting to happen. There are two or three really big companies, probably FTSE 100 companies, that want to list in London but are just waiting for the right time."

"The biggest factor of the credit crunch has been to lose the world something like two years growth in production and it may even be more than that because you can't borrow money to build a mine anymore," said Williams.
"Everyone thinks prices are high but just come back in a year's time and I think we are going to see some amazing prices," he said.
