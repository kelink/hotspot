Grupo Mexico positive on '09 copper prices, demand
Thu  EDT
) said on Thursday strong demand from China coupled with tight global supply meant prices for the red metal were unlikely to fall below $2 per lb in 2009, although the company maintained its annual guidance of $1.75 per lb.
"We believe that the infrastructure plans in the United States and China are going to lead to important demand," Grupo Mexico's Chief Financial Officer Daniel Muniz said at the Reuters Latin American Investment Summit in Mexico City.
Muniz said that because of the positive price outlook, the company had not yet hedged any of its copper production.
"Up until now we have not hedged anything and this is due to our positive view on the prices," he said.
While the Mexican company drastically cut capital expenditures due to uncertainty caused by the financial crisis, Muniz said Grupo Mexico would have no trouble meeting its 2009 target of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion.
He also said Grupo Mexico, which controls railroads in addition to mines in Mexico and South America through its mining division Southern Copper PCU.N, said it was on track to produce 470,000 tonnes of copper and 17,000 tonnes of molybdenum this year.
