China's Hu invites North Korea's Kim to visit-KCNA

The invitation, made to a visiting official of the North's ruling Workers' Party, Choe Thae-bok, came in a meeting on Wednesday where the two countries pledged to strengthen ties as they celebrate 60 years of alliance. [ID:nPEK337141]
"At the meeting, comrade Hu Jintao asked Choe Thae-bok to convey his invitation to General Secretary Kim Jong-il to visit China at a time convenient to him," the North's official KCNA news agency said on Thursday.
Kim said during a visit to Pyongyang by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao earlier this month that his country would be willing to return to the six-way disarmament talks, but after holding direct talks with long-time adversary the United States.
A senior North Korean nuclear envoy is in the United States and meeting State Department officials on the sidelines of academic seminars. The meetings may be a prelude to a visit to Pyongyang by senior U.S. nuclear envoys, analysts said.
Kim's last trip to China was in January 2006. The secretive leader's few journeys abroad are almost never confirmed until the train carrying him crosses the border back into the North.
A trip to China in 2000 was soon followed by a summit in Pyongyang with South Korea's leader and the start of two major development projects in North Korea.
The 2006 visit did little to resolve the nuclear standoff and was followed by North Korea's first nuclear test about 10 months later. (Reporting by Jack Kim; Editing by Jon Herskovitz)
