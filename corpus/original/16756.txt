Roberto Cominotto, fund manager, Julius Baer: "Our bank believes we have seen the trough of the economic downturn.
"But there is a risk of a double dip in 2010. It's quite difficult to work out what the recovery will look like because the downturn was extremely sharp and fast."
Jean-Jacques Mosconi, head of strategy and planning at Total (
), said: "You have better signals coming from China and the Middle East, but is it enough to offset still very bad signals coming from the Western world.
"Maybe the worst is over, but it's a little bit too early to say the crisis is over."
Cominotto: "It's very difficult to forecast... If the economy will continue to improve, may be next year $80 is a reasonable assumption."
Mosconi: "We're living with $50."
"Next year we see more than that, $60, and then we may be back to $80. Our view is we're going back to $80 in the next two years."
"When you are BP or Total, it's easier to get credit than if you are an independent company."
