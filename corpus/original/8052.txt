UPDATE 1-China Minsheng's US bank loss to have limited impact

(Reuters) - China Minsheng Banking Corp (
), which is raising up to $4 billion through a public offering of shares in Hong Kong, said on Tuesday that its failed investment in U.S. lender UCBH Holdings Inc UCBH.O will have a limited impact on its business.
UCBH's main unit United Commercial Bank was closed by U.S. regulators last Friday and its banking operations were acquired by East West Bancorp Inc [ID:nN06212635].
Minsheng, which has invested 887 million yuan for a 9.9 percent stake in UCBH, has recognised 824 million yuan ($120 million) of losses for the investment, the Beijing-based lender said in a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
"Since we have already made relatively adequate loss provisions for UCBH, we think that the closure of United Commercial Bank won't have a huge impact on our operations or profits."
The announcement comes as Minsheng, China's first privately-run lender, launches an IPO in Hong Kong this week to raise up to $4 billion to replenish capital for further expansion.
Minsheng's failed investment in UCBH underscores the risks Chinese financial institutions face in overseas acquisitions.
In October, 2007, Minsheng bought a 4.9 percent stake in California-based UCBH, which was the biggest lender in the United States serving the Chinese community, and raised its stake in the bank to 9.9 parent last December.
