Tue  EDT
* Gained from refined copper flows to China, higher prices
The London-based company said its commodities business, particularly physical metals merchanting, benefitted from record flows of refined copper into China and the sharp rally in copper prices since the start of the year.
"Our balance sheet remains highly liquid," Chairman Lawrence Banks said in a statement.
The company, which provides corporate finance, stock broking and commodity trading services, said its mix of businesses positioned it well to benefit from the eventual recovery in global demand for natural resources.
