(Reuters) - Nepal's president said on Thursday that the Himalayan nation's new constitution would be ready on schedule, insisting political turmoil since former Maoist rebels quit would not delay the work.
President Ram Baran Yadav said a 2006 peace deal and other agreements with the former rebels would be honoured and urged the Maoists, who quit the government two months ago, to cooperate.
"The priority of the government is to prepare the new constitution on time and take the peace process to a logical conclusion," Yadav told the parliament in Nepali.
A specially elected assembly, dominated by the Maoists, is tasked with preparing a new constitution by May 2010, part of the deal that ended a decade-long civil war, abolished the monarchy and turned the impoverished nation into a republic last year.
But the political turmoil since the resignation of the Maoist-led government in May has stalled the peace process and some analysts fear the crisis could delay the preparation of the constitution, a key part of the landmark peace deal.
The culmination of the peace deal also includes the tricky task of deciding the fate of more than 19,000 former Maoist fighters housed in 28 camps monitored by the United Nations.
"The work of taking care of the Maoist fighters, their rehabilitation and integration will be completed before the new constitution is written," Yadav said.
Yadav angered the Maoists in May when he blocked their plan to fire the country's army chief, saying he had refused to take orders from the government.
