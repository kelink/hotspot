(Reuters) - Leaders of Japan, China and South Korea on Saturday agreed to seek a trilateral investment treaty by the end of this year as a way to speed up talks on a free trade pact among the three countries, a senior Japanese official said.
They also agreed to finish studies by their governments, industries and experts on the proposed free trade agreement by the end of December so that they could start formal negotiations on the trade pact.
"The liberalization of investment rules is one of the big elements for broader free trade pacts," the Japanese foreign ministry official told reporters.
