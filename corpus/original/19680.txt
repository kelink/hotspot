(Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso's offering to a controversial shrine for war dead will not derail his summit with China, Beijing's ambassador to Tokyo said, urging the two powers to focus on the financial crisis.
Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai made the remarks while visiting Hong Kong, a mainland-run Hong Kong newspaper, Ta Kung Pao, reported on Friday.
Cui said recent visits to the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo by Japanese lawmakers would not "create too much damage on China-Japan relations and will not affect Prime Minister Taro Aso's schedule to visit China on the 29th (of April)," the paper said.
The Yasukuni shrine to millions of war dead -- including some convicted as criminals by a post-World War Two tribunal -- is seen by China and other Asian countries as a symbol of Japan's lack of contrition for bloodshed and atrocities in the 1930s and 1940s.
The ambassador's comments were reported a day after the Chinese Foreign Ministry said it was angry with Aso's offering of a potted tree to the shrine.
Cui's comments were more subdued. He said Aso's talks with Chinese leaders during his two-day visit would focus on surmounting the global financial crisis.
"The main topics will be how to keep developing China-Japan relations and how to fight the global financial tsunami," he said.
