(Reuters) - Ukrainian iron ore producer Ferrexpo Plc (
) said demand has strengthened in its core markets as Europe restocks and the global economic outlook improves, but added that contract prices had dropped.
"The majority of Ferrexpo's European customers are now taking their full contract volumes, despite in many cases not being at 100 percent capacity utilisation themselves," said Chief Executive Kostyantin Zhevago.
However the company, which reverted to selling most of its production to long-term contract customers in the third quarter, said contract prices were about 48.3 percent lower than for the 2008/2009 contract year.
Ferrexpo's total pellet production from its own raw materials in the third quarter fell 0.8 percent to 2.25 million tonnes from the year-earlier quarter. The company had previously released monthly output figures on its website. [ID:nL0229245]
