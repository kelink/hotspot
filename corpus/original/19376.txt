(Reuters) - The HSBC Champions tournament in China has been given World Golf Championships (WGC) status, to become one of four events on the worldwide calendar one rung down from the majors, golf officials said Tuesday.
The European and Asian Tour co-sanctioned tournament joins the United States-based WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, the WGC-CA Championship and the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational events.
The elevation of the Shanghai-based event reflects China and the region's growing stature in international golf, the International Federation of PGA Tours and the China Golf Association said in a statement.
"This is one of the most significant steps ever taken in the globalization of golf and one of the most logical," PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem said.
The inaugural edition at Shanghai's Sheshan International Golf Course on November 5-8 will offer prize money of $7 million.
World number one Tiger Woods, who played in the tournament's first two editions, said in a statement: "I am looking forward to returning to Shanghai this November.
First held in 2005, the most recent HSBC Champions was won by Spaniard Sergio Garcia in Shanghai in November when the tournament carried an overall purse of $5 million.
The Asian and European Tours both welcomed the improved status of the event, seeing the move as proof of how highly regarded golf in the region has become.
"The elevation of the HSBC Champions into a WGC event represents the growing importance of golf in Asia," Asian Tour chief Kyi Hla Han said.
"As a member of the International Federation of PGA Tours, the Asian Tour is delighted to be an integral part of this wonderful development."
European Tour chief executive George O'Grady echoed Han's glowing endorsement.
"The enhanced status of the tournament... will see the PGA Tour join as a sanctioning body, meaning that the event is now sanctioned by all the world's Tours," O'Grady said.
