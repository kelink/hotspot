(Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei average danced in and out of positive territory on Tuesday with market players saying that moves in dollar/yen were largely driving the market, while investors were also keeping an eye on Chinese stocks.
Some market players said that they believed that the correlation between moves in currency markets and Tokyo stocks had grown stronger after Sunday's election victory for the Democrats as some party officials have said Japan should start thinking of a strong yen as in its interest. [ID:nT87477]
The yen gained on Monday, helping to push the Nikkei lower.
"The yen moves are driving the market. Auto trading programmes linking the dollar/yen moves and the Nikkei have likely set in," said Fumiyuki Nakanishi, manager at SMBC Friend Securities.

"But all of that is happening when the market entered a natural corrective phase, with the Nikkei having gained nearly 50 percent from its March lows. It's not as if the view on a recovery for the global economy had changed," Nakanishi said.
In light trade, the benchmark Nikkei
was up 0.5 percent or 48.08 points at 10,540.61.
It fell 0.4 percent on Monday, hitting an 11-month high at 10,767.00 at one stage as the market struggled to interpret the results of Sunday's election.

"Moves in the Chinese stock market are also in focus as demand from the country has supported exports on which Japan has been heavily depended for growth," said Takahiko Murai, general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities.
"But as a whole, there's no clear direction for fund flows at the moment."
