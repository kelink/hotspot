(Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (
) has hiked its 2009 and 2010 copper price forecasts, partly because of a strong recovery in China, the world's largest consumer of the metal used in power and constrution.
The bank raised its 2009 copper price forecast by 48 percent to $2.14 per lb from $1.45 previously. For next year, the forecast was raised 52 percent to $2.50 per lb.
"Demand from China for strategic reserve purposes and commercial restocking has been a main driver of price support," Morgan Stanley said.
In the near term, however, there was a risk that an end to Chinese restocking and a seasonal lull in demand will contribute to a price correction.
Morgan Stanley expected this would be short lived, partly because China's economic recovery continued to widen and deepen.
Also, leading indicators of global industrial production like purchasing managers indices have started to reverse the strong downtrend seen in the second half of 2008.
Demand for copper outside China remained weak on account of the global recession, but Morgan Stanley noted copper has held up better than most investors expected.
"In base metals, our preferred exposure is copper, with short term downside price risk providing a new entry point after the recent strong rally," it said.
