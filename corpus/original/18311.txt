(Reuters) - Belarusian teen-ager Victoria Azarenka, chasing her fourth WTA Tour title of the year, dismissed Peng Shuai of China 6-4 6-1 in the second round of the Madrid Open Wednesday.
The 19-year-old seventh seed, who has won in Brisbane, Memphis and Miami, claimed six breaks on Peng's serve and will play Hungarian Agnes Szavay Thursday for a place in the quarter-finals.
Russian sixth seed Svetlana Kuznetsova failed in her bid for a third straight final appearance when she was upset 6-3 6-2 by Alona Bondarenko, her third loss on clay to the unseeded Ukrainian in three previous meetings.
Russian qualifier Vera Dushevina became the first player through to the last eight when she won her third-round match against Italy's Francesca Schiavone 6-3 4-6 6-2.
World number one Dinara Safina, who had a bye into the second round, is due to play China's Li Na later Wednesday and Safina's Russian compatriot and the number three seed Elena Dementieva takes on former number one Amelie Mauresmo.
Serena and Venus Williams, the second and fifth seeds, are both already out of the tournament.
