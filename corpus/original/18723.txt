(Reuters) - China has decided to lift its flu quarantine on a group of Canadian students but the Canadian government said on Wednesday it would demand an explanation of why they had been confined.
Canadian foreign affairs spokesman Alain Cacchione said he had just been informed the students would be released on Thursday morning. Canadian officials said there were 28 students in the group, 22 of them Canadian.
Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon signaled Ottawa's displeasure with the Chinese action.
"We've delivered a diplomatic note to the Chinese foreign ministry and asked them to give us fulsome explanations as to why these individuals were quarantined, given the fact that there were no visible signs of any health problems," he told reporters in Parliament.
The quarantine on the students was imposed before the discovery of the infected herd and was taken in light of the fact that some people in Canada had contracted the flu. (Reporting by Randall Palmer; editing by Rob Wilson)
