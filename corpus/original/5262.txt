(Reuters) - Here are some facts about Chinese human rights activist Liu Xiaobo. China declared on Tuesday most nations supported its call to boycott this week's Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony for the jailed dissident.
* Liu was prominent in the 1989 pro-democracy protests centered on Tiananmen Square that were crushed by armed troops, and was jailed for 20 months.
* In 1995, Liu orchestrated several daring petitions to parliament by groups of dissidents and intellectuals. He was held for more than seven months without formal charges.
* On September 30, 1996, Liu and veteran pro-democracy activist Wang Xizhe issued a statement urging the communist authorities to honor a promise in 1945 to give people religious freedom, freedom of the press and speech, and the freedom to form political parties and hold demonstrations.
* Within weeks, Liu was sentenced to three years in a labor camp.
* In December 2008, he helped to organize the "Charter 08" petition, which called for sweeping political reforms. It was published on the 60th anniversary of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
* A group of prominent foreign academics, lawyers and writers including several Nobel laureates wrote to Chinese President Hu Jintao asking for Liu's release.
* In December 2009, Liu was jailed for 11 years for "inciting subversion of state power" for his role in the petition and for online essays critical of the Communist Party.
* In May, Liu was moved to Jinzhou Prison in Liaoning, his home province.
-- Liu Xiaobo was born on December 28, 1955, in the city of Changchun in Jilin province.
-- After middle school, he was sent to the countryside to work in farms, then worked at a construction company in Changchun.
-- In 1977, he was admitted to study Chinese literature at Jilin University, and created a poetry group with six fellow students: The Innocent Hearts (Chi Zi Xin).
-- In 1982, he began postgraduate literature studies at Beijing Normal University, starting an academic career that would lead to a professor's position at the university.
-- In 1987, his first book, "Criticism of the Choice: Dialogues with Li Zehou," on philosophy and aesthetics, became a non-fiction bestseller. It challenged the ideas of professor Li Zehou, a rising ideological star with great influence on young intellectuals.
-- He returned to China as student protests broke out in Beijing in 1989. His third book, "The Fog of Metaphysics," a comprehensive review of Western philosophies, was published the same year.
-- An empty chair is to represent Liu at Friday's awards ceremony and symbolize China's policies to isolate and repress dissidents, a top Nobel official told Reuters.

WHY is there no mention that Liu took serious money from a foreign entity funded directly by a hostile government (which government by the way is demanding Liu¡¯s release, no less). How much money? The court papers did not say (other than stating that he accepted the money and his wife picked up the money from the bank). Some say that the NED site previously published actual numbers, but the numbers have since been removed from the site. But US$600,000 or $1,000,000 had been suggested (sums so huge that no average Chinese can hope to make in a whole lifetime). Liu also tried to influence the politics of his mother nation, demanding the abolition of the form of government expressly provided in the Chinese Constitution. That sort of conduct (take foreign money and influence politics) is punishable and punished in most countries in the world. At least be complete with the record.
