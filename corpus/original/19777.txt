UPDATE 1-China COSCO seeks to cut, delay ship orders

), the world's largest dry bulk shipper, posted a bigger-than-expected second-half loss and said it was in talks to delay or cancel some new ship orders to help weather the market downturn.
The country's largest shipping group (
) forecast a substantial drop in international trade this year as the global economy contracts and squeezes China's export environment.
"Considering the market conditions, the Group is negotiating with shipowners to postpone delivery of three 8,495 TEUs vessels to 2010," COSCO said in a statement.
China COSCO, the world's No.6 container ship operator, had an order book of 59 container vessels with a total shipping capacity of 444,752 twenty-foot-equivalent units (TEU) at the end of 2008. It had 141 container vessels with total capacity of 496,317 TEUs at end-2008, up 14.1 percent from a year ago.
In 2009, the group is expected to take delivery and use nine newly built vessels with a total capacity of 60,411 TEUs.
The company had an order book of 58 dry bulk vessels, with a total 7.5 million dead weight tonnes (DWT) at end-2008, and owned, operated and controlled 443 dry bulk vessels with total 34.36 million DWT.
China COSCO posted a net loss of 3.5 billion yuan ($512.6 million) in the second half as freight rates collapsed in the fourth quarter, leaving the firm with hefty hedging losses.
The net loss, calculated from previously reported earnings, compared with a 12.25 billion yuan profit in July-December 2007, and was well short of an average forecast for a 1.08 billion yuan profit from 8 analysts polled by Reuters.
Full-year net profit fell 40 percent to 11.62 billion yuan, and included a 4.12 billion yuan net loss against purchases of Forward Freight Agreements (FFA) and 5.2 billion yuan provisions for onerous contracts.
