Russia's Medvedev announces greenhouse gas target

(Reuters) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev set greenhouse gas emission goals on Friday, saying Russia would aim to cut emissions by 30 billion tonnes between 1990 and 2020.
Russia's goal would allow a rise in greenhouse gases of 29 to 36 percent above current levels by 2020, assuming the target was compared with 1990 emissions as implied but not clearly spelt out but by Medvedev.
Russia is the third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and the United States, and has not previously given long term goals for cutting its emissions.
"Based on the current situation by 2020 we could cut emissions by about 10-15 percent," Medvedev told Russian state television, according to a copy of his comments supplied by the Kremlin, without referring to a baseline.
"In total terms, what does this mean? It will mean that from 1990 to 2020, that is to say over 30 years, we will cut the volume of our emissions by an aggregate volume... of 30 billion tonnes," Medvedev said.
"It's not enough, it's very low," said Alexey Kokorin, WWF spokesman for Russia, referring to the 2020 target and assuming Medvedev meant a 1990 baseline. "It's really negative."
Medvedev said Russia would take a responsible approach to greenhouse gas emissions, but Moscow expected other countries to also work on cutting emissions.
"We really need to set the volume of greenhouse gas emissions that we are going to cut, because they have an extremely negative effect on the global climate," Medvedev said.
"At the same time we will not cut off our development potential," he added.
Russia's heavy industry and carbon emissions collapsed in the 1990s after the end of the communist era, during a transition to a more competitive, liberalised economy.
Russia's greenhouse gas emissions were 2.2 billion tonnes in 2007, 34 percent below 1990 levels. Using a 1990 baseline, Friday's target implies 2.8-3.0 billion tonnes in 2020.
During the previous presidency of Vladimir Putin, Russia's top Kyoto officials insisted that they would not take on mandatory emissions cuts for fear of hindering the comfort of Russia's middle class and the development of its industries.
