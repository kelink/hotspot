"I believe deeply that it's very important to the United States, to the economic health of the United States, that we maintain a strong dollar," Geithner said in a meeting with Japanese reporters at the U.S. embassy.
He said the United States was well aware it needed to work to keep investors' confidence in U.S. economic policymaking.
"We bear a special responsibility for trying to make sure that we are implementing policies in the United States that will sustain confidence ... in investors around the world that as growth recovers and growth strengthens that we're going to bring our fiscal position back to a sustainable balance," he said.
Geithner said he was encouraged by Tokyo's commitment to seek more economic growth through domestic demand rather than exports.
"We're at a point now where I think we all recognize that although the world economy is now growing again, you don't yet have all the conditions for a self-sustaining recovery led by the private sector," he said.
"It's going to take continued, carefully designed support from government policy as a bridge to that recovery," Geithner added. "It's too early on a global basis to see people shift to restraint."
In response to repeated questions about China's policy of closely managing the exchange rate for its yuan currency, Geithner credited China with helping get the global economy out of crisis and welcomed Beijing's commitment to adopt a more flexible currency over time.
