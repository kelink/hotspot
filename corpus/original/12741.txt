(Reuters) - Britain's blue chip index hit new closing and intraday highs for the year on Monday, driven by strength in banks, as results from Barclays and HSBC pleased investors, and helped by solid gains on Wall Street after data.
The FTSE 100 ended 74.10 points, or 1.6 percent higher at 4,682.46, its highest closing level since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in early October 2008, having also reached an intraday peak for 2009 of 4,710.23 on Monday.
"Investor sentiment is becoming more and more optimistic by the day and so far this week the banks are fuelling the momentum," said Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads.
HSBC rose 5 percent as it reported a pretax profit for the six months to the end of June of $5.02 billion, down from $10.2 billion a year earlier but just ahead of the consensus forecast.
"The banking sector's return to profitability should be considered a good thing, not just for the financial markets, but for the UK taxpayers too as their stake in RBS and Lloyds look more likely to give a return on their investment, albeit still over the long run", Campbell said.
