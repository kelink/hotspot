(Reuters) - An early agreement on a global trade deal is possible with more cooperation and negotiators are working overtime for the success of the Doha round of talks, a World Trade Organization (WTO) official said on Saturday.
"We have actually come ahead in a big way," Harsha Vardhana Singh, WTO Deputy Director General, said in New Delhi.
"In the Doha round, the focus that is being emphasized is that we should try and move together in various sectors ... So we are trying to move forward in a horizontal manner," Singh told an industry body on Saturday.
Key trade ministers will meet in New Delhi early next month to relaunch the talks, which collapsed in July last year at the WTO, largely through differences between the United States and big emerging countries such as China and India over measures to protect subsistence farmers from floods of imports and eliminate duties in some industries.
"We can do it by focusing in a constructive and creative way. The political emphasis is already there, what we require is substantive senior level technical engagement," Singh said.
"A constructive mindset, a willingness to get together, improve the situation ... is what we need today."
"You need to get in touch with each other and show greater sensitivity to each other's requirements," Singh said.
The Doha round could be successfully concluded by next year, he said. "I think it is achievable."
