(Reuters) - China denied on Friday any link to a batch of 69 Patriot missiles confiscated by Finnish authorities, saying the weapons were destined for South Korea.
"As far as we know these goods were made in Germany and were being sent to South Korea. This is a British ship which left Germany carrying Patriot missiles for South Korea," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin told a daily news briefing.
Some reports have said the missiles were destined for China, but Liu said that was not the case.
"I don't see what connection this boat has with China. We think it odd that some people always link certain things to China. The facts are all very clear," he added.
The surface-to-air missiles were found on Wednesday when authorities searched the cargo ship Thor Liberty in Kotka, southern Finland. They also discovered 150 tons of explosive material called nitroguanidine, which was not stowed properly.
China is subject to an arms embargo by the United States and European Union imposed after the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators around Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.

China isn¡¯t that amateur, if they wanted Patriot missiles, they would simply design it themselves. A New Zealander made a Tomahawk-esqe missile for under $5000. If a man can do it as a hobby, I¡¯m pretty sure a Chinese man with a degree in the subject could make one.
