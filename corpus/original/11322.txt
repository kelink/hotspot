"With no major negative news in sight and technical trading dominating, the index should have limited potential to fall below its recent low (of 2,761 points hit last Wednesday)," said Zheng Weigang, head of investment at Shanghai Securities.

While most investors believed Wen's comments contained nothing surprising, worries over a possible slowing of China's economic recovery were used as an excuse to launch a fresh round of selling, traders said.
