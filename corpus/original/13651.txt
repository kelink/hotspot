(Reuters) - Finnish lift maker Kone (
) posted strong second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, helped by tight cost controls and a strong order book powered by demand from China, and said it expected full-year results to improve.
Kone shares jumped on the results, hitting a year-high of 24.58 before cooling slightly to trade up 7.4 percent at 24.33 euros at 1235 GMT.
Kone's April-June operating profit rose 6.6 percent to 146 million euros ($206.7 million) versus a year ago, topping the mean estimate of 142 million in a Reuters poll.
"The good operating income was primarily a result of the development programs that have led to improved productivity, favorable development in sourcing costs and tight cost control," the company said in a statement.
"I am very pleased with our performance in the second quarter. Our orders received were higher than in the previous three quarters despite the weakened market environment," Kone Chief Executive Matti Alahuhta said.
Sales rose to 1.17 billion euros from 1.14 billion a year ago, slightly lagging the 1.19 billion forecast in the poll, but the firm's order intake of 954 million euros trumped all expectations as demand from China grew.
The company tweaked its full-year outlook, saying it now targeted annual sales growth of 2-5 percent, with underlying operating profit to rise to 570-595 million euros. Expectations in the poll were for a profit of 569 million.
"Consensus ... was in the lower end, so in that sense the forecast was a positive surprise," a Helsinki-based analyst said.
"But this is only for this year. Next year will hardly be as positive ... except for China, which seems to be driving things a bit better," he added.
Kone said it had booked 33.6 million euros in one-time costs in the quarter, part of its 40-million-euro cost savings programme announced in the first quarter.
It said it aimed to cut 500 jobs within the next nine months due to the weak market, but would continue to recruit in stronger markets, such as China.
