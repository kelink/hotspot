(Reuters) - Britain's top share index edged down on Monday pressured by miners and banks, with investors booking profits from hefty gains last week, while the market searched for direction as the earnings season tailed off.
The FTSE 100 <.FTSE 100> ended down 0.2 percent, or 9.36 points at 4,722.20, not far from a 10-month closing high of 4,731.56 on Friday after reassuring non-farm payrolls numbers from the United States boosted investor sentiment.
A recovery in corporate earnings and improving macroeconomic data has fuelled a rally in British stocks over the past few weeks, with the index rebounding 36 percent since the all-time low in March, and has gained 2.5 percent so far this month.
"It is a small pause after the push up last week. Everyone is having a look to see whether it can continue after the big numbers on Friday. It will be a very interesting week whether it can hold on (to recent gains)," said Richard Griffiths, senior trader at Spreadex Ltd.
