Factbox: China and India endorse Copenhagen climate plan
2010-03-09 00:18:00.0
(Reuters) - China and India signed up to the Copenhagen Accord for fighting climate change on Tuesday, joining almost all other major greenhouse gas emitters in endorsing the non-binding pact.
Russia is the largest greenhouse gas emitter yet to make clear if it wants to be associated with the deal, reached at a summit in December, which has strong backing from the United States.
The accord sets a goal of limiting a rise in world temperatures to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F), but does not set out how to achieve the target. Rich nations also aim to give $100 billion a year in climate aid from 2020.
The number of backers has risen to just over 100 of 194 member states. Of these, more than 60 have also issued domestic goals for reining in climate change by 2020. A U.N. analysis indicates these pledges will only be sufficient to limit global warming to 3 degrees Celsius (5.4F).
* UNITED STATES - 17 percent from 2005 levels, or 4 percent from 1990 levels.
* EUROPEAN UNION (27 nations) - 20 percent, or 30 percent if others act.
* CANADA - 17 percent from 2005 levels, matching U.S. goal.
* AUSTRALIA - 5 percent below 2000 levels, 25 percent if there is an ambitious global deal. The range is 3-23 percent below 1990.
* BELARUS - 5 to 10 percent, on condition of access to carbon trading and new technologies.
* NORWAY - 30 percent, or 40 if there is an ambitious deal.
* LIECHTENSTEIN - 20 percent, or 30 percent if others act.
* MONACO - 30 percent; aims to be carbon neutral by 2050.
DEVELOPING NATIONS' ACTIONS FOR 2020
* CHINA - Aims to cut the amount of carbon produced per unit of economic output by 40 to 45 percent from 2005 levels. This "carbon intensity" goal would let emissions keep rising, but more slowly than economic growth.
* BRAZIL - Aims to cut emissions by between 36.1 and 38.9 percent below "business as usual" levels with measures such as reducing deforestation, energy efficiency and more hydropower.
* SOUTH AFRICA - With the right international aid, South Africa says its emissions could peak between 2020-25, plateau for a decade and then decline in absolute terms from about 2035.
* INDONESIA - Aims to reduce emissions by 26 percent by 2020 with measures including sustainable peat management, reduced deforestation, and energy efficiency.
OTHERS' PLEDGES
* ARMENIA - Increase renewable energy output, modernize power plants, restore forests.
* BENIN - Develop public transport in Cotonou, better forest management, methane recovery from waste in big cities.
* BHUTAN - Already absorbs more carbon in vegetation than it emits from burning fossil fuels; plans to stay that way.
* BOTSWANA - Shift to gas from coal. Nuclear power, renewables, biomass and carbon capture also among options.
* CONGO - Improve agriculture, limit vehicles in major cities, better forestry management.
* COSTA RICA - A long-term effort to become "carbon neutral" under which any industrial emissions will be offset elsewhere, for instance by planting forests.
* ETHIOPIA - More hydropower dams, wind farms, geothermal energy, biofuels and reforestation.
* GABON - Increase forestry, bolster clean energy
* GHANA - Switch from oil to natural gas in electricity generation, build more hydropower dams, raise the share of renewable energy to 10-20 percent of electricity by 2020.
* IVORY COAST - Shift to renewable energies, better forest management and farming, improved pollution monitoring.
* JORDAN - Shift to renewable energies, upgrade railways, roads and ports. Goals include modernizing military equipment.
* MACEDONIA - Improve energy efficiency, boost renewable energies, harmonize with EU energy laws.
* MADAGASCAR - Shift to hydropower for major cities, push for "large scale" reforestation across the island, improve agriculture, waste management and transport.
* MAURITANIA - Raise forest cover to 9 percent by 2050 from 3.2 percent in 2009, boost clean energy.
* MONGOLIA - Examining large-scale solar power in the Gobi desert, wind and hydropower. Improve use of coal.
* MOROCCO - Develop renewable energies such as wind, solar power, hydropower. Improve industrial efficiency.
* PAPUA NEW GUINEA - At least halve emissions per unit of economic output by 2030; become carbon neutral by 2050.
* SIERRA LEONE - Set up a National Secretariat for Climate Change, create 12 protected areas by 2015, protect forests.
* SINGAPORE - Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 16 percent below "business as usual" levels if the world agrees a strong, legally binding deal.
* SIERRA LEONE - Increase conservation efforts, ensure forest cover of at least 3.4 million hectares by 2015. Develop clean energy including biofuels from sugarcane or rice husks.
TOGO - Raise forested area to 30 percent of the country by 2050 from 7 percent in 2005; improve energy efficiency.
Other nations asking to be associated, without outlining 2020 targets: Albania, the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Bosnia, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Chile, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Fiji, Guatemala, Guyana, Kiribati, Laos, Lesotho, Malawi, Mali, Montenegro, Namibia, Nepal, Palau, Panama, Peru, Rwanda, Samoa, San Marino, Senegal, Serbia, Tanzania, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Uruguay.
Ecuador, Kuwait and Nauru reject association. The Philippines will support the Accord if developed nations make deep and early cuts.
