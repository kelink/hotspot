Shanda CEO Diana Li also told a media briefing over the weekend that the company's 18 Fund investment unit would step up its efforts to acquire established online game companies as well as investing in and supporting early-stage online game products.
"Over the next five years, average (annual) growth in China's online game industry will be 18.4 percent, and globally it will be 17.7 percent," Li said. "Our company's growth will exceed this average pace."
Her industry estimates indicated a marked slowdown from the sector's recent rapid growth.
The Chinese online game industry's sales in 2008 surged 76.6 percent from a year earlier to 18.38 billion yuan ($2.7 billion), and a Chinese government official estimated in July that it would grow 30 to 50 percent this year to 24 billion to 27 billion yuan.
Li said Shanda would also expand into overseas markets, such as the United States, with a relatively large population and a growing online game market, although it would move cautiously.
She did not give a figure for the company's overseas revenue this year but said it was still small, in the $10s of millions, while up about seven-fold from last year.
