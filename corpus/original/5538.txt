Clinton: U.S. seeks China policy change on currency

(Reuters) - The United States is looking for China to make "responsible policy adjustments" on both currency and trade in order to ensure a better climate for U.S. business, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Thursday.
"On currency and trade, the United States seeks responsible policy adjustments that have been clearly articulated by (Treasury) Secretary Geithner and a better climate for American businesses, products and intellectual property in China," Clinton said in Honolulu, where she is beginning a 13-day trip through the Asia-Pacific region.
Clinton's trip will include a Saturday stop on China's Hainan Island, where she will meet State Councilor Dai Bingguo, a key figure when it comes to Beijing's U.S. policy.
The two are expected to discuss a range of issues centering on preparations for Chinese President Hu Jintao's expected visit to the United States in January, but also likely to touch on economic and other issues that have caused friction in recent months.
"As I talk with business leaders across our own nation, I hear how important it is for the United States to expand our exports and our investment opportunities in the dynamic markets of Asia. These are essential features of the rebalancing agenda of our administration," Clinton said in a speech on U.S. Asia policy.
Washington has repeatedly pressed China to allow its currency to appreciate against the U.S. dollar to aid U.S. exports, while trade frictions have recently been underscored by concern over China's near-monopoly on rare earth materials which are vital to many high-tech products.
Clinton's trip also follows a period of increased tension between China and some of its neighbors over maritime territorial issues, although U.S. officials say both sides are actively seeking to smooth ties ahead of Hu's U.S. trip.
