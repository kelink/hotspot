* Report says HudBay considering options, including sale (Adds details, comments)
TORONTO, April 24
The Globe and Mail newspaper quote HudBay chief executive Peter Jones as saying the Winnipeg, Manitoba-based miner has hired a bank to examine options that could include sale of the company or acquisitions of other miners.
By mid-afternoon, the company's shares had risen 44 Canadian cents to C$7.39 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
David Whetham, a fund manager at Scotia Cassels, said HudBay's solid cash position makes it both an attractive target and a potential buyer.
"It sounds like they're definitely looking to grow by acquisition, but at the same time, if somebody comes in with an offer, it could go both ways," he said.
He said HudBay's copper smelter in Flin Flon, Manitoba, could deter a potential buyer.
Jones began his second stint as HudBay's CEO last month after a failed attempt to take over fellow Canadian miner Lundin Mining (
) prompted a shareholder revolt that forced the company's former board and management to step down.
Jones's first turn as CEO ended when he was pushed out in January 2008 for not seeking acquisitions aggressively enough. He said in March that HudBay would try to expand through takeovers, and may be open to overtures from larger players.
Jones was part of a slate put forward by shareholder SRM Global Master Fund, which wanted HudBay to distribute its war chest of approximately C$700 million to shareholders.
The company also said in March that it had had discussion with third parties concerning a possible sale of the company, but no discussions were underway at that time.
