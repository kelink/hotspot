"Between 1 and 1.5 billion euros," Varin was quoted as saying by Il Sole 24 Ore on Saturday in relation to the year's operating loss.
He added that the company aimed to be in the black in 2010, but cautioned that "it's an objective, not a forecast".
Last month, Varin said he was sticking to a forecast of an operating loss for 2009 of between 1 and 2 billion euros, with the goal of being at the better end of the range. [ID:nWEA0911]

Varin added that the company would focus on strengthening its presence in markets such as China and South America. "Launching in new markets is not under discussion," he added.
He said Peugeot had decided to deepen its cooperation with Germany's BMW (
). "Above and beyond diesel engines, we are also thinking of agreements on components and purchasing," Varin said.
