-- Yunnan Metallurgical Group has agreed to take over Alcoa Inc's (
) fully owned subsidiary in Shanghai, said Dong Ying, chairman of the Chinese company. He gave no financial details of the deal.
-- China should continue to allow small but steady increases in bank lending in the second half of the year rather than suddenly slamming on the brakes after lending was pushed to the limit in the first half, said Tang Shuangning, chairman of Everbright Bank.
-- Yuan-denominated bank loans in Shanghai increased by 17.1 billion yuan in July, slowing sharply from 99.9 billion yuan in June, data provided by the Shanghai branch of China's central bank showed.

-- New bank loans in China are estimated to come to more than 3 trillion yuan in the second half, unnamed bank executives said.

-- The combined volume of provincial gross domestic product is 1.4 trillion yuan ($204.8 billion) higher than that of the national figure for the first half of this year that was issued by the National Statistics Bureau. Local governments largely assess their officials' performance on provincial GDP growth, leading to exaggerated output levels, and the discrepancy could provide a misleading view of economic trends.
