Europe bailout fund chief courts China

(Reuters) - The head of Europe's rescue fund sought to entice China on Saturday to invest in the facility by saying investors may be protected against a fifth of initial losses and that bonds could eventually be sold in yuan if Beijing desires.
Expanding the EFSF to 1 trillion euros is key to the euro zone's latest anti-crisis plan, put together at a Eurozone summit this week. Details on how this would be done have yet to be finalized and European leaders are under pressure to show the plan would work.
"The EFSF will take a certain tranche that will be a junior tranche, which means if something goes wrong, the first loss will be carried by the EFSF. It could be around 20 percent," Regling told students at the Tsinghua University.
Regling, chief executive of the EFSF, said the fund could sell bonds in yuan in future if Beijing so desired. But he said that would be difficult to pull off right now.
"We have so far only issued euro bonds but we are authorized to use any currency we want if it seems efficient," he said.
"It also depends on the Chinese authorities, whether they would approve that. I think it is probably more difficult. But I could imagine that over the years it might happen."
Regling was visiting cash-rich China two days after euro zone leaders struck the deal to boost the firepower of the EFSF, recapitalize banks and reduce Greece's crippling debt burden.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy immediately got on the phone to China after the summit to seek financial help, saying Beijing had "a major role to play."
Europe has said the EFSF may be expanded either by offering insurance to buyers of euro zone debt in the primary market, or via a new special purpose investment vehicle that it hopes would draw funds from China and Brazil, among other countries.
The deal has left major economies Italy and Spain under pressure. Italy's borrowing costs jumped at a bond auction on Friday. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was forced to promise reforms to quash speculation that his government was about to collapse.
Regling made clear he wanted to determine what it would take for Beijing to put more money in the EFSF. But he hinted it was also in China's interests to have a healthy euro and an alternative to the dollar as a reserve currency.
"Many particularly large economies in the world want to have ... the euro as part of the international monetary system. That is a good reason to support our program," Regling said.
When asked why Beijing should buy more euros and risk currency losses if the bloc launches another round of quantitative easing, Regling said the European Central Bank had been prudent in growing its balance sheet, compared to the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.
"I can assure you should invest in the euro, this is not the problem," he said. "The ECB has only one objective -- price stability and they will deliver."
Stuck with elevated inflation, China worries that ultra-loose monetary policies abroad will further stoke price pressures at home. It has repeatedly scolded the United States for its quantitative easing, deeming it "irresponsible."
Some analysts agree that China has far more upside than downside in providing support for Europe, not least in protecting its global trade. But it may drive a hard bargain to part with some of its $3.2 trillion foreign exchange reserves, the world's largest.
Beijing is, nonetheless, cautious. Although China has expressed confidence that Europe can survive its crisis, it has made no public offer to buy more European government debt.
The careful stance was underscored on Friday by Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao, who said Beijing was awaiting details on new investment options for the EFSF before deciding its next move.
He shrugged off any notion, in his discussions with students, that the euro zone project could unravel, saying that the currency bloc remained united.
"There is no political intention to kick out any country," he said. "It would not be in the interest of any countries, not economically, not politically."
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
China is taking a significant gamble in providing economic support to the US and her European allies. The Western countries are in debt up to their eyeballs and they are very hesitant in taking the necessary steps to bring their debt under control. China would be well advised to consider further investments in the West very carefully. In addition, China may want to remember that the West didn＊t do very much to help the Asian countries during their time of economic crisis in the late 1990s.

EU and Ez is mainland China＊s largest export market. Therefore, not only does China have economic interest but also national interest in ensuring EZ continues to work and develop as a major global player. As I said, earlier, IMF will be responsible (ultimately) to initiate institutional arrangement by which China could increase its current (large!) investments in EFSF 每 stability fund 每 and establish its own bonafide with EU 每 going forward 每 with its new and incoming leadership.

China＊s $3.2 trillion reserve # is misleading. Their local governments have ball park 10.7 trillion RMB in debt (http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304803104576427062691548064.html), much of which as incurred in useless infrastructure projects intended to create employment, to keep the Communist Party in control. Beijing has a policy of (1) promoting / favoring regional communist officials who drive high GDP growth by any means necessary, such as building bridges to nowhere, and (2) not giving the regional governments money.
