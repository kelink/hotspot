(Reuters) - China's Wanhua Industrial Group could soon become a minority shareholder in private-equity owned chemicals company BorsodChem [BDCD.UL], after it agreed to back the Hungarian company's debt restructuring plan.
Wanhua will only gain a stake in BorsodChem once a debt restructuring deal for the firm is in place and Wanhua puts up additional capital for BorsodChem, BorsodChem Chief Executive Wolfgang Buchele told Reuters after the agreement was signed.
"There will be no immediate shareholding. They will only become a shareholder once the restructuring deal is put in place and they put additional equity capital on the table, and in exchange they will become a minority shareholder," Buchele said over the phone.
He said the majority shareholding would remain with BorsodChem's current owners, British private equity fund Permira [PERM.UL] and Vienna Capital Partners (VCP).
"It will be a qualified minority (for Wanhua) together with the hedge funds (which hold some of BorsodChem's mezzanine debt)," Buchele said.
"The term sheet governs the agreed upon midterm role of Yantai Wanhua as a minority shareholder of BorsodChem as well as the agreement to the company's debt restructuring plan, which is also strongly supported by the senior lenders and the Hungarian government," BorsodChem said in the statement.
BorsodChem, one of the biggest employers in eastern Hungary, has to reach a deal on a restructuring of its debt with its creditors and needs the support of Wanhua in this.
"But there is still a long way to go. Several questions remain unresolved for the time being and will be addressed only at a later stage," BorsodChem said in the statement.
According to earlier press reports, Wanhua, the largest isocyanate producer in Asia Pacific, via two Hong Kong-based funds, had bought up most of BorsodChem's mezzanine, or junior, debt, which has subordinated claims over the company's assets.
Last week senior lenders of BorsodChem expressed their support of the current management of BorsodChem and their expectations that Permira and VCP should remain majority shareholders and exercise operational control, BorsodChem said.
