(Reuters) - European shares hit their highest close since Jan. 6 on Monday, with enery companies and miners among the biggest gainers as data from the United States and China sparked optimism on economic recovery.
"There's more risk appetite. I think market participants are increasingly reassured about the strength of the economic recovery coming through," said Henk Potts, strategist at Barclays Stock Brokers, in London.
"(Historical) data tells us the situation isn't getting any worse, and the forward-looking data indicates a positive response to the monetary and fiscal stimulus."
Prices for crude oil CLc1 and copper MCU3=LX hit seven-month highs, sending shares in miners and energy companies sharply higher.
