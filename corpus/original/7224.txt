-- The People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's main mouthpiece, came in ninth place in the world and second in China, with a circulation of 2.81 million per issue.
-- While many newspapers are published by city governments or industry bodies, there are also 39 newspaper groups, which ran a total of 271 newspapers by 2008.
-- China had 9,549 magazine titles by the end of 2008. A total of 310.5 million magazines were issued in 2008.

-- Chinese magazines' advertising and circulation incomes were 3.1 billion yuan and 16.7 billion yuan, respectively, in 2008.
-- Most Chinese provinces, cities and even counties have their own television stations. The total number is believed to be more than 2,000. Some also broadcast in regional languages like Tibetan, Uighur and Mongolian, as well as Mandarin.
-- Advertising income for Chinese television stations was 50 billion yuan in 2008, including 16 billion yuan for CCTV, the country's main state broadcaster.
-- The revenue for cable networks' subscription fees in China was 33.4 billion yuan in 2008.
