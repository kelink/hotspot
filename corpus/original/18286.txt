(Reuters) - Hong Kong confirmed on Wednesday its second case of the new H1N1 flu virus and said it was hunting for more than 50 passengers sitting near the infected man who had just returned from the United States.
"He arrived on the evening of May 11 and was sent straight to hospital after visiting the airport clinic," said Thomas Tsang, controller of the Centre for Health Protection.
More than 50 passengers sat in the three rows in front and behind the 24-year-old Hong Kong man on flight CX 879 from San Francisco to Hong Kong, and Tsang urged them to contact the government hotline.
"His fever was mild ... but the scanners are useful as they can still pick up people with high fever," Tsang said, adding that family members of the Hong Kong man were now quarantined at the MacLehose holiday campsite in the New Territories.
Hong Kong's first confirmed H1N1 case, which involved a Mexican man, was reported on May 1, leading to the quarantine of a downtown hotel where he had stayed. Some 300 guests and staff were confined to the Metropark hotel, in Wanchai, for a week in a controversial bid to prevent any spread of the virus.
Authorities in Hong Kong have since revised their flu containment strategies, saying for future cases involving an infected hotel guest only certain floors would be quarantined. (For more Reuters stories on swine flu, click on [nFLU]) (For more Reuters swine flu coverage, please see:
