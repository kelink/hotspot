(Reuters) - China's securities watchdog has approved a bond issue by Shanghai Yuyuan Tourist Mart (
) of up to 1 billion yuan ($146 million), IFR Asia reported, reopening the corporate bond market which has been suspended for 10 months.
The company received the green light from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) on July 13, the first such permission since September last year, IFR said on Tuesday, without citing sources.
There are around 35 companies for a total issuance of more than 115 billion yuan in the pipeline. Those deals been initially approved by the CSRC but are still waiting for the administrative permits to tap the bond market, it said.
Existing shareholders will not have pre-emptive rights to the bond issue, IFR said. For the first tap, 10 percent of the deal is slated for online subscriptions on July 17 while the rest is earmarked for institutional investors between July 17 to 21.
