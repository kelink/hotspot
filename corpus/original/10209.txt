(Reuters) - BP and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) signed an oilfield contract with Iraq that marked a milestone in the country's plan to open up its vast oil resources to world oil majors.
Rumaila is the workhorse of Iraq's oil industry with a capacity of 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd), almost half Iraq's total output of 2.4 million bpd.
* The initial production rate is to be agreed by the companies and Iraq on the day the contract is ratified or before, and will be calculated as the average production rate over a 30 day period.
* The firms must aim for sustained output, or "plateau production target," for a period of seven years of 2.85 million barrels of crude and natural gas liquids per day.
* Within 30 days of the deal being finalized the contractors must pay a signature bonus of $500 million. The money is recoverable over 20 quarterly payments, payable from the ninth quarter following the quarter in which the deal is ratified.
* BP and CNPC's bid for the Rumaila contract was for remuneration of $2 per barrel.
* BP and CNPC may be paid in oil or cash. Iraq can choose to reimburse the companies' supplementary costs in oil or cash, but the firms can decide how their service fees are paid.
* The Rumaila oilfield service contract lasts for 20 years, but it can be extended.
* The companies must submit an enhanced redevelopment plan, based on knowledge gained from the field's initial rehabilitation, within three years of the contract's ratification.
* Discovered but undeveloped oil reservoirs at Rumaila may be produced under the contract, but will be subject to a separately agreed remuneration fee.
* Grounds either party to declare force majeure include an act of God, war (declared or undeclared), force of nature, insurrection, riot and fire.
* They also include in certain circumstances, for BP and CNPC only, government orders or legislation.
