(Reuters) - Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (
), Asia's largest listed bourse operator, posted a fourth straight drop in quarterly profit as the global crisis battered trading volumes, though turnover picked up last month as funds bought into China's growth prospects.
Market turnover, which accounts for the bulk of HKEx's earnings, improved in April as hefty fund inflows flooded the local market on optimism that the global economy is about to turn the corner, driven in part by China's continued growth.
"Despite glimmers of hope that global fiscal policy stimulus may be working, with the economy sinking into recession, HKEx's financial performance is likely to be adversely affected," it said in a statement.

) and Australia's ASX Ltd (
), said it will work more closely with Chinese authorities and exchanges to seek mutual benefits for their securities markets.
January-March net profit fell to HK$834.24 million ($107.6 million) from HK$1.65 billion a year earlier, lagging two analysts' forecasts for HK$891 million and HK$918 million.
But the value of trading rebounded 39 percent in April to a daily average of about HK$62 billion, analysts said.

Trading at about 32 times 2009 earnings, HKEx remains the most expensive of Asia's three big listed bourse operators, versus Singapore Exchange's 29 times and ASX's 18 times, according to Reuters Estimates.
