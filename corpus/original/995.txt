China's BOC Aviation joins late Airbus order scramble
2013-01-15 14:36:00.0
(Reuters) - BOC Aviation, the aircraft leasing arm of Bank of China Ltd (
), has placed its largest ever order to buy 50 A320 family jets from Airbus (
The deal, signed in December, brings an end-year scramble of Airbus orders to more than 200 jets worth $25 billion in the past four weeks, and puts the European planemaker on course to report more than 900 orders for 2012.
But the European planemaker's winter offensive will not be enough to prevent Boeing (
"After a couple of years of depressed market conditions, we are beginning to see that the market is turning," Robert Martin, BOC Aviation's managing director and chief executive officer, said on Tuesday.
"Now we are replenishing our pipeline. This is a leasing company. You want a pipeline of orders to grow your business going forward," he told Reuters.
The deal, which includes 25 revamped versions with new engines, comprises A320 and A321 variants with delivery scheduled from the second half of 2014 to the end of 2019.
With this deal, BOC Aviation's outstanding orders for new aircraft total 100, including planes from Airbus, its major rival Boeing Co (
), and Embraer SA (
The list price of the deal is around $5 billion, but large orders typically involve substantial discounts on that price.
Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Airbus looked set to report more than 900 orders for 2012, anticipating a surge in orders before the January 17 announcement.
Boeing is expected to win back the crown as top-selling planemaker after posting 1,339 orders for last year.
Industry sources say Airbus is expected to end 2012 with a market share around 41 percent, but will talk up its performance when the last two unusually volatile years are combined.
Airbus will however acknowledge this week that it slipped behind Boeing in aircraft deliveries in 2012. Industry sources say it handed 588 aircraft to customers compared to Boeing's 601, giving the U.S. company a market share of 51 percent.
Including the latest flurry, Airbus has so far announced 851 orders attributable to 2012. This excludes a $2 billion order for 10 jets from U.S. lessor CIT which is seen as a 2013 deal.
The global aviation market will need $4 trillion of new aircraft over the next 20 years, according to estimates from Boeing. Around half of those new planes are expected to be owned by leasing firms, and China will be a major growth market.
As passenger traffic grows and the industry's center of gravity shifts towards Asia, cash-rich Chinese investors want greater exposure to the international aircraft leasing market.
BOC Aviation's assets are expected to rise by 25 percent to $10 billion in mid-2013 from $8 billion at the end of June 2012, Martin said.
Last month a Chinese consortium led by New China Trust agreed to buy nearly all of American International Group Inc's (

This order should have been expected because China is expanding its infrastructure for transportation into central and western provinces in its 12th Five Year Plan. China will also increase road and rail transportation options, but it needs more aircraft for increases in domestic and international flights.
