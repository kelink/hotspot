(Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries edged down on Monday as regional stocks rose on reviving economic recovery hopes, and ahead of a record $115 billion supply this week.
* More signs of economic recovery and stock market gains might temper demand for safe-haven government bonds, traders said, as they awaited data on June new-home sales later in the day expected to show a slight gain from May.
* Treasuries showed a muted reaction to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's remarks that the U.S. jobless rate is likely to stay high even once the nation exits recession some time in the next few months. [ID:nN26478726]
* The Treasury will sell $6 billion in reopened 20-year inflation-protected securities (TIPS) on Monday, followed by a $42 billion sale of two-year notes on Tuesday, $39 billion of five-year notes on Wednesday, and $28 billion of seven-year notes on Thursday.
* But longer-dated bonds looked vulnerable due partly to uncertainty over whether the Fed will extend its programs to buy long-term Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities, analysts and traders said.
* Benchmark 10-year notes edged down 3/32 in price to yield 3.674 percent US10YT=RR, up a basis point from late U.S. trade on Friday. The 10-year T-note futures were nearly flat on the day at 116-11/32 TYv1.
* The two-year notes inched down 1/32 in price to yield 1.023 percent US2YT=RR, up about 2 basis points. The 30-year bonds fell 6/32 in price to yield 4.556 percent US30YT=RR, up about a basis point.
* Asian stocks rallied on Monday with Tokyo's Nikkei share average rising to its highest in more than nine months above the psychologically important 10,000 mark. [MKTS/GLOB][.T] (Editing by Hugh Lawson)
