UPDATE 1-CNPC delays first south China refinery

(Reuters) - Top Chinese oil firm CNPC will postpone the start-up of its first major refinery in southern China to the first half of 2010 from the second-half of this year, a company newspaper reported on Wednesday.
Construction of the 200,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Guangxi refinery will be completed by year-end and operations will begin in the first half of 2010, Wu Enlai, general manager of Guangxi refinery, was quoted as saying by the China Petroleum Daily.
CNPC, operating its core businesses ranging from oil and gas exploration, production, refining and sales via listed PetroChina (
), had cut its oil production target this year by 4 percent from 2008 levels while scaling back crude processing goals by 1.4 percent amid signs of weakened demand in the wake of the global economic slowdown.
Analysts had expected the world's second-largest oil user to either delay the start-up of new refineries that could amount to around 1 million bpd or lower processing rates to cope with a potential supply glut.
But some recent signs have shown that the world's third-largest economy may recover sooner than later, quickening a recovery in fuel demand, which could lead to an upward revision of operating plans by major oil firms.
China's implied oil demand in March dipped 0.3 percent over a year earlier, but stood at its highest rate since last September as refiners ramped up output after a pick-up in domestic sales thinned stocks. [ID:nPKE133935]
