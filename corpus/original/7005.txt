CIC has made no secret of its ambitions to develop its own investment expertise so it can manage more of its money by itself, cutting down on fees in the process.
Lou Jiwei, the chairman of CIC, said the fund would manage more of its investments in developed markets internally this year and steadily accelerate its overseas investments, the China Securities Journal reported.
"As of now, most of CIC's overseas funds are managed by outside portfolio managers, but we will gradually increase in-house investment in more efficient developed markets in the future," the newspaper paraphrased Lou as saying in an article he published on Monday. It did not say where the article appeared.
CIC has been investing intensively in resources and commodities since 2009, mainly because there is still plenty of room for price gains in those sectors, Lou said.
CIC also needed to hedge against the risk of inflation as the world economy picked up, he added.
Lou restated CIC's policy to operate the fund as a financial investor seeking to maximize its returns, not to control the companies in which it invests.
