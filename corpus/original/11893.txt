(Reuters) - London landlord Shaftesbury (
) said a record influx of overseas and domestic tourists has boosted tenants in its core West End market, shrinking vacancy rates and shoring up lettings activity.
The company, which owns more than 450 properties in London's Theatreland, Chinatown and Carnaby Street districts, said it continued to see healthy demand for its property and has reduced its vacant space to 69,000 square feet by end-July, from 74,500 square feet in March.
It said it had lettings worth 956,000 pounds ($1.58 million) in the pipeline, more than double the volume seen in March.
Offsetting Britain's lingering economic recession, Shaftesbury said the rental value of its vacant space -- excluding space undergoing refurbishment -- was 800,000 pounds in July.
The company said it was making good progress with construction of a new shopping and leisure hub at St. Martin's Courtyard.
Based on current enquiries, it said the retail and restaurant components of the project, which represent around 60 percent of its 5.2 million pounds projected rental income, would be let and trading at completion in summer 2010.
In contrast, Shaftesbury cautioned against continued weakness in the office market, where values remain under pressure.
The company is in talks to let offices representing around 119,000 pounds of rental income, while space estimated to generate a further 1.14 million pounds was either undergoing refurbishment or ready to let.
Shaftesbury, which raised almost 150 million pounds of fresh spending power in a 2-for-3 share sale in May, has bought 20 million pounds of property since April.
