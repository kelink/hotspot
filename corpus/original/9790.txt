According to Chinese documents uncovered by the University of North Korean Studies and the Woodrow Wilson Center, former North Korean leader Kim Il-sung had advance knowledge of the 1961 coup in South Korea led by Park Chung-hee and expressed misgivings about it to China.
Following the signing of a free trade agreement between South Korea and the European Union, the finance and agriculture ministries laid out plans on Thursday to compensate farmers who will be negatively affected by the agreement. The Korea Rural Economic Institute issued a report estimating local agriculture production would shrink by 2.80 trillion won ($2.42 billion) within 15 years of the agreement coming into force.
