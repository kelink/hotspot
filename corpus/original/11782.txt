Following are some key events in the history of GM's Saab Automobile unit:
1937 - SAAB or Svenska Aeroplan Aktiebolaget founded in 1937 in Trollhattan, southwestern Sweden, to produce high-performance aircraft. It ventured into cars in 1946.
1990 - The Saab car division is restructured into an independent company, Saab Automobile AB, with headquarters in Sweden. Investor AB and General Motors own 50 percent each.
Jan. 11, 2009 - GM has been in talks to sell its struggling Saab unit, GM Europe chief Carl-Peter Forster says.
Feb. 17 - In a restructuring plan submitted to the U.S. Treasury, GM says it will cap its financial support for Saab and aims for the brand to become independent as of Jan. 1, 2010.
Feb. 20 - Saab's fight for survival is boosted as a Swedish court grants it protection from creditors while it tries to find a new partner and raise fresh funds.
-- Saab estimates it lost $340 million in 2008 and it expects a similar loss for 2009, blaming slack demand, ageing products, overcapacity and high costs.
May 19 - Saab says it has selected three suitors for continued talks, but does not reveal who they are.
June 17 - A Swedish court approves a 75 percent writedown of Saab's more than 10 billion Swedish crowns ($1.28 billion) of debt owed mainly to GM, helping Saab move a step closer to new ownership by Koenigsegg.
June 30 - Saab could increase production to meet higher demand if it secured bridge financing from the government, chief executive Jan Ake Jonsson says.
-- Sweden is negotiating with Koenigsegg on a possible guarantee for a loan to Saab from the European Investment Fund, a pre-condition for the deal.
