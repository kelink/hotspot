China Development Bank in fray for troubled German bank: report

(Reuters) - State-owned China Development Bank is among the four final bidders to buy a large stake in stricken German lender WestLB in a deal that could be valued around $13 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported.
Other bidders in the fray are U.S. leveraged buyout firms Blackstone Group, Apollo Global Management and J.C. Flowers & Co, banking sources and the Journal, which cited sources familiar with the deal, said.
A full takeover may be unlikely given the troubled bank's exposure to risky sovereign debt and a big need for funds.
China Development Bank, which has done some preliminary due diligence on the lender, may proceed cautiously and seek a minority stake or a corporate tie-up, sources told Reuters.
It already has a tie-up with another German Bank, HSH Nordbank.
The state-owned lender is seeking to beef up its deposit network and has shown up at other German bank auctions, underscoring its determination to expand its banking footprint.
WestLB has a strong foothold in lending to Germany's mid-size companies, a big project financing business and also a strong capital markets business.
Partially owned by the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia and local savings banks, it has been put on the block at the request of the EU as a condition for regulatory approval of state aid granted in the financial crisis.
Analysts and investment bankers have said that while the sale of parts of WestLB could go through, they gauge a sale of the complete bank as unlikely.
