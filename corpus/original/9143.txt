Kirk and Locke are the U.S. co-chairs of the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, which is led on the Chinese side by Vice Premier Wang Qishan. The meeting is set for Wednesday and Thursday in Hangzhou.
Many U.S. manufacturers believe Beijing keeps its currency, the yuan, undervalued against the dollar to give Chinese exporters an unfair advantage in international trade.
The yuan, also known as the renminbi
, rose 21 percent against the dollar from 2005 to July 2008 but has budged little since then.
President Barack Obama complained loudly about China's currency practices during last year's campaign, but he has taken a softer approach since taking office.
In a semi-annual report this month, Obama's Treasury Department said China's yuan was "undervalued".
U.S. trade officials, speaking on condition they not be identified, declined to say last week whether Kirk and Locke would raise China's exchange rate policies this week.
But "obviously, currency is part and parcel of our overall economic relationship with China," a USTR official said.
Locke, during a trip to China in July, said the United States wanted Beijing to move to a "freer floating exchange rate." (Reporting by Doug Palmer; Editing by James Dalgleish)
