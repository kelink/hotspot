(Reuters) - Taiwan's parliament has passed a trade pact with China, the last hurdle for about 800 tariff cuts favoring Taiwan exports to its biggest market and a key step in forging further economic tie-ups.
The following is an overview of the landmark Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) deal, the strongest tie-up ever between long-time political rivals China and Taiwan.
China will cut import tariffs on items with a total export value of $13.84 billion and Taiwan will reduce them for items worth $3 billion. Tariffs will fall to zero within two years, officials from the two sides said.
* 18 agricultural products, from bananas to live fish
* Raw materials, including a range of oils
* Tires for cars, large vehicles and bicycles
* Glasses, wrist watches and toothbrushes
* Taiwan banks in China could begin doing business in Chinese yuan currency a year earlier than current rules allow, with the effective date depending on when each bank opened.
* China's computer services, airline maintenance and medical sectors will be open to Taiwanese investment.
In China, companies in Fujian province, which is geographically closest to Taiwan, could get a boost. Among them are Fujian Cement and Industrial Bank.
