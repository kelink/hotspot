) has struck price "fairness" agreements with Chinese steel mill customers because of uncertainty over the future pricing of ore, the company's chief executive said on Tuesday.

Strong imports in recent months have strengthened the hand of global miners, who are still locked in protracted talks with China's steel industry over 2009 term prices.
The talks were clouded this year by Rio's rejection of a further tie-up with Chinese aluminium group Chinalco, and by China's detention of four Shanghai-based Rio iron ore employees for allegedly stealing state secrets.
Imports at China's main ports in July rose 35 percent compared with July 2008 to 56.5 million tonnes, a report on the Ministry of Transport website said on Tuesday, a rise of 2.2 percent from official numbers for last month.
