(Reuters) - European stocks were higher midday on Thursday, climbing for the 12th time in 14 sessions, as a raft of better than feared company results fuelled the market's sharp three-week rally.
index of top European shares was up 1.3 percent at 922.80 points, after rising to as high as 923.35 points, the index's highest level since mid-November.
"The market looks as if it will continue to push higher on the back of better corporate earnings and a more benign economic outlook," said Manoj Ladwa, senior trader at ETX Capital, in London.
"But a lot of the improvement in corporate performance has been down to cost cutting, stock market volumes are still low, confidence is fragile and there are a growing number of bears," he warned. Stronger than expected corporate earnings have given a second wind to an equities rally that wilted in June after a 38 percent gain in the FTSEurofirst 300 from its record low reached in early March.
Europe's benchmark index, now up 43 percent since its March floor, has surged 13 percent over the past three weeks. But it is still down 44 percent from its multi-year peak touched in mid-2007.
"The earnings season gives the market a nice tailwind. Investors should not become careless but we are far from the end of the world," said Roger Peeters, strategist at Close Brothers Seydler.
Mining and steel stocks were also on the upside, rising along with metal prices after China reassured global markets by reaffirming loose monetary policy. Rio Tinto (
), BHP Billiton (
) bucked the trend, down 1.8 percent after the company reported a sharp decline in third-quarter operating earnings.
BASF BASF.DE, the world's largest chemicals maker, 4.3 percent as its second-quarter net income came in below analyst expectations.
According to Thomson Reuters data, among the STOXX 600 index's .STOXX 95 companies that have reported results so far, 50 beat analysts' estimates, two matched and 43 missed the estimates. The actual earnings fall for the DJSTOXX 600 based on the 95 companies results improved to 45 percent on Wednesday's close from 55 percent a week ago.
"Earnings are a positive indication, but with the market's jump we got over the past three weeks stocks aren't really cheap anymore," one Paris-trader said.
