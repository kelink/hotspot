(Reuters) - China's main stock index fell more than 5 percent on Monday to a three-month low, breaking below the key 125-day moving average used by Chinese investors to delineate a bull versus a bear market, as a series of negative factors has relentlessly weighed down the market since early August.
"Liquidity worries, too much share supply and weakening investor sentiment prevailed in the market today, although these are not fresh negative factors," said Qian Qimin, deputy head of research at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities in Shanghai.
plunged as much as 5.4 percent to 2,706.129 points, putting it on track to post a more than 20 percent loss for the month after recording seven consecutive monthly gains.

Monday's fall came after the index closed down 2.9 percent on Friday as sources familiar with the situation told Reuters that regulators warned banks not to rush into end-of-the-month lending amid signs of a steep drop in Chinese bank lending in August. [ID:nSHA316054]
Analysts said that, while the slowdown in lending would trim liquidity flowing into stocks, it should have no major impact on the economy, partly because Chinese firms are turning a large share of the short-term discounted bill financing they received in the first half of this year into long-term investment in the second half.
"Although July data showed China's economic recovery may not be as quick as the markek had once expected, it is still on track," Qian said.
