(Reuters) - Taiwan's government on Wednesday said it would not examine a plan by China Mobile (
) to buy a stake in Taiwan's Far EasTone now, as the island's telecom industry was not on the initial list of investments to be allowed.
Last week, China said it was setting up rules to let its companies invest in Taiwan from May, while China Mobile, the world's top mobile carrier by users, said it planned to buy a 12 percent stake in Far EasTone (
The acquisition is technically not allowed under Taiwan Law that prohibits Chinese companies from investing in Taiwan's telecommunications companies.
"If (the category) is open in the future, then we will accept and examine this case if they apply to us for approval," Emile Chang, deputy executive secretary of the investment bureau at the economics ministry, told Reuters.
Taiwan is preparing to allow a range of investments by Chinese investors for the first time from May, as ties with Beijing, a former political rival, thaw under a year-old China-friendly Taiwan adminsitration.
China has claimed sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Beijing has previously vowed to bring the self-governed democracy of 23 million people back under mainland rule, by force if necessary.
