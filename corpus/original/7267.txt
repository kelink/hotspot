U.S. clears arms sale to Taiwan despite China ire

(Reuters) - The United States has cleared a sale of advanced Patriot air defense missiles to Taiwan despite opposition from rival China, where a military official suggested sanctions on U.S. firms who sell weapons to the island.
The U.S. defense department announced the contract late on Wednesday, allowing Lockheed Martin Corp to sell an unspecified number of Patriots, Washington's de facto embassy in Taipei said.
The hardware, some of the best in its class, could shoot down Chinese short-range and mid-range missiles, defense analysts say.
The sale rounds out a broad $6.5-billion arms package approved under former U.S. President George W. Bush in late 2008, said Wendell Minnick, Asia bureau chief with Defense News.
"This is the last piece that Taiwan has been waiting on," Minnick said.
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said the United States should "cancel plans concerning arms sales to Taiwan and stop selling these weapons, to avoid damaging broader China-U.S. relations."
Meanwhile, Vice Admiral Yang Yi, told the China News Service that though developing good ties between China and the United States was important, some things could not be accepted.
"You can't just be forebearing and conciliatory when it comes to the development of stable and healthy Sino-U.S. relations, and especially when it comes to a question of principles you should never blindly make concessions," he said.
Some U.S. companies which sell weapons to Taiwan also want to sell aircraft and other goods to China, added Yang, who is also a researcher at the Chinese National Defense University's Strategic Studies Institute, without naming any firms.
"Why don't we take defensive countermeasures against them? Apart from just protesting to the U.S. government and taking necessary steps, why don't we put sanctions on these troublemakers?"
China has claimed sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan since 1949, when Mao Zedong's Communists won the Chinese civil war and Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists (KMT) fled to the island. Beijing has vowed to bring Taiwan under its rule, by force if necessary.
The United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, recognizing "one China." But it remains Taiwan's biggest ally and is obligated by the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act to help in the island's defense.
"Taiwan's defense ministry looks favorably at the U.S. continuing to sell Taiwan weapons for its self defense," Taiwan military spokesman Martin Yu said. Taiwan estimates that China is aiming 1,000 to 1,500 missiles at the island.
