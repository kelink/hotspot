FACTBOX: The Shanghai Cooperation Organization

(Reuters) - Members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), a group of Central Asian states, gathered in Beijing on Wednesday to discuss economic cooperation. Here are some facts about the SCO:
WHAT IS THE SHANGHAI COOPERATION Organization?
-- The SCO was founded in Shanghai in 2001 by the leaders of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Russia and China. It evolved from an earlier regional security grouping formed in 1996 after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the Central Asian states gained independence.
-- India, Pakistan, Iran and Mongolia are observers. Afghanistan attends as an invited guest. Pakistan and Iran are keen to become full members.
-- The member states occupy a territory of 30.2 million sq km, or three fifths of the Eurasian landmass, and have a population of over 1.5 billion, or a quarter of the world's population.
-- The SCO initially focused on regional security and confidence-building, including border conflicts, terrorism, and militant Islam. SCO activities have expanded to cover cooperation in economics and trade, transportation and law enforcement. Security and economic cooperation remain priorities.
WHAT DOES THE SCO DO?
-- Some Western commentators have likened the SCO to a potential NATO-like security grouping that could challenge the West. In practice, however, the organization has limited itself to smaller military exercises and security initiatives.
-- China and Russia are the overwhelmingly dominant members of the SCO. Russia regards Central Asia as its historic sphere of influence, while Chinese economic sway there has been growing. At an informal level, the SCO is a diplomatic platform that helps to address and contain potential friction in the region.
-- In August 2008, Russia failed to secure the backing of the SCO member states on recognizing two disputed regions of Georgia -- South Ossetia and Abkhazia -- that were at the heart of Moscow's brief war with Georgia.
-- The group has played only a muted role in discussing regional trouble-spots, such as Afghanistan and Iran. In March, the SCO members met in Moscow to discuss the spread of violence and drugs from Afghanistan.
-- The SCO held its first joint military exercises in 2003. Most of the full members of the SCO took part in war games in April this year, when about 1,000 soldiers held exercises near the Tajik capital Dushanbe. Uzbekistan declined to take part, saying its special services had other commitments.
-- At a meeting of SCO state leaders in June, Chinese President Hu Jintao offered Central Asian states $10 billion of credit support to help counter the global economic slump. No details have emerged of that offer, and it remains unclear how much of the money, if any, has been handed out.
