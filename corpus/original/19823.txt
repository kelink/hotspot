(Reuters) - Husky Energy Inc's (
) assets in Southeast Asia may be worth up to C$5 a share if the company follows through on plans to spin them off, an analyst said on Wednesday.
In a note to clients, William Lacey of FirstEnergy Capital said the assets could be worth between C$3 and C$5 per share in a spinoff, much more than the value that the market currently attributes to them.
"We believe shareholders are currently placing little value on (Husky's) Asian portfolio," Lacey wrote.
Its assets in the region include 100 percent of the massive Liwan natural gas discovery, an offshore field southeast of Hong Kong that could contain as much as 6 trillion cubic feet of gas. It also owns part of the Wenchang oil field in the South China Sea and the Madura BD gas development in Indonesia's Madura Strait.
China's biggest offshore energy company, CNOOC Ltd (
), is Husky's partner in its Wenchang and Madura plays. CNOCC also has the right to acquire up to 51 percent of Liwan. Lacey said the state-controlled firm may be interested in acquiring all of Husky's assets Southeast Asian assets itself.
However if the spun-off company remains independent "we believe that a publicly traded vehicle such as this would be very well received as it would represent a tradable pure-play energy focused investment that is focused on one of the largest, and growing, energy markets in the world - China," Lacey wrote.
Husky shares rose 58 Canadian cents, or 2 percent, to C$29.68 on Wednesday afternoon on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
