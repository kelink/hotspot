(Reuters) - Drybulk shipping company DryShips Inc (
) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, helped by a recent rise in spot charter rates and increased contribution from its offshore drilling segment, sending its shares up as much as 6 percent in trading after the bell.
Charter rates for drybulk ships which ferry commodities such as iron ore, coal, and grains have been rebounding from their lows over the last few months.
Dayrates for capesize ships -- the largest type of drybulk ships -- averaged about $40,000 a day for the second quarter, double the first-quarter average of about $20,000.
"The last several months the dry bulk freight markets have recovered to healthy levels led by strong growth in China," Chief Executive George Economou said in a statement.
"We are also beginning to see signs of improvement from other regions, with steel mills in Europe, Japan and elsewhere restarting idle capacity," he added.
"During the quarter they've moved 11 Panamax vessels that had been on the spot market over to two-year fixtures," analyst Scott Burk of Oppenheimer & Co said over the phone.
Burk estimates that each of the 11 vessels have been fixed at charter rates of about $15,000 to $18,000 per day by DryShips. "That's what boosted their EBITDA coverage to $1.6 billion," Burk added.
For the second quarter of 2009, the company reported a net profit of $52.8 million, or 24 cents a share, compared with $299.8 million, or $6.95 a share, last year.
Excluding items, the drybulk shippers' earnings for the latest quarter was 25 cents a share. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 23 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.
Total revenue fell 30 percent to $210.5 million, hurt by the crash in charter rates from last year. Analysts had forecast revenue of $202.9 million.
"Other than that looks like things are just par for the course," he said.
