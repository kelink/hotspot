(Reuters) - Mexico complained at the World Trade Organisation on Wednesday that seven countries continue to block imports of its pork over concerns about H1N1 flu.
At a WTO meeting on the safety and hygiene of traded goods, the United States, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Brazil and others stressed that trade restrictions in response to the flu "have no scientific justification", officials said.
Ukraine, Indonesia, China and Jordan are among the countries that imposed pork bans and barriers in response to the outbreak of H1N1.
China defended its aggressive moves to limit pork imports, citing its large vulnerable population and the importance of pigs and pork in the Chinese diet, diplomats said.
The others cited were Armenia, Bahrain, Gabon, Indonesia, Jordan and Surinam, a WTO official said. (Reporting by Laura MacInnis; editing by Robert Woodward)
