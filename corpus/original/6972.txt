Also denting investor appetite for risk was wavering confidence over the ability of European leaders to solve Greece's debt problems and curb the impact on struggling economies elsewhere.
Crude oil fell about 1.5 percent as China's decision to increase its reserve level for banks by 50 basis points sparked fears that a slowdown in lending would curb demand for commodities imports. Crude oil prices were also hurt by data showing U.S. oil and gasoline inventories rose more than expected last week.
The move by China on the eve of its New Year's holiday was the second time this year it has increased the reserve level for banks as it aims to prevent the economy from overheating by slowing lending and tempering inflation.
"We see the tightening on China's side is going to be ratcheted up, which removes liquidity from the U.S. equity market," said Steven Grasso, director of institutional sales at Stewart Frankel and Co Inc in New York.
"If we were all betting on the recovery story, that recovery might be delayed."
fell 45.05 points, or 0.44 percent, to 10,099.14. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
declined 2.96 points, or 0.27 percent, to 1,075.51 and the Nasdaq Composite Index
rose 0.28 percent to 2,183.53.
Large manufacturers and commodity-related companies were among the biggest decliners, with many dependent on Chinese demand. Aluminum company Alcoa Inc (
In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300
> closed down 0.27 percent at 987.86 points, ending a four-day winning streak as banks and mining stocks were hurt by the news on China and Greece's debt problems.
"The rise in banks' reserve requirements reduces the leverage of the Chinese to buy, and China are big buyers of raw materials, so this has weighed heavily on mining stocks," said Mic Mills, senior trader at ETX Capital.
Greek bank shares sagged 5 percent after the Greek economy shrank more than feared in the fourth quarter, and a European Union government source said meetings of the region's finance ministers next week were unlikely to put together an aid package for Athens.
The China news drove investors to the traditional safety of the dollar, with an index of the dollar against other major currencies .DXY gaining 0.4 percent to 80.311. The index earlier hit 80.748, its best level since July 2009.
The euro slid to a near nine-month low against the dollar at $1.3533, as the China news came on top of concerns about the lack of any detailed plan to rescue Greece and anemic euro zone growth. In New York, the euro was down 0.48 percent at $1.3615.
Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.32 percent to 90.01 yen.
Although the European Union sent a "clear message of solidarity" with Greece on Thursday, tempering fears of a broader crisis in the euro zone investor sentiment was on edge amid persistent worry that other euro zone countries may run into similar trouble.
Economic data also sparked concerns that Europe's recovery may be starting to falter, with euro zone gross domestic product expanding a meager 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter.
Prices were little changed after U.S. retail sales for January topped forecasts. Retail sales grew by 0.5 percent, compared with a consensus estimate of 0.3 percent. Also, U.S. consumer confidence slipped in February.
Commodities fell, with U.S. light sweet crude oil down settling down $1.15, or 1.5 percent, to $74.13 per barrel.
Spot gold prices fell $2.55, or 0.23 percent, to $1092.40 and the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index .CRB dropped 0.66 percent.
Signs that European leaders would support Greece encouraged bargain-hunting in Asia, and Japan's Nikkei rose 1.3 percent.
Investor focus in the European fiscal saga is meetings next week between EU finance ministers. Meantime, markets will likely remain volatile given difficulty in aligning support for fiscally struggling euro zone nations, analysts said.
"Until we get more details on a political solution for Greece, the euro is going to stay under selling pressure," said Kasper Kirkegaard, currency analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen.
