Gains were limited by a lower-than-expected read on U.S. retail sales, a sign that the world's largest economy continues to have areas of weakness.

U.S. retail sales rose 0.4 percent in June, only half the 0.8 percent rate economists polled by Reuters had expected. The disappointment was tempered by accelerating growth in New York State's manufacturing sector in July, according to a report from the New York Federal Reserve that provides one of the earliest monthly guideposts to U.S. factory conditions.
The mixed picture added to the debate over when and how quickly the Federal Reserve would start to slow its stimulus program, which has been widely credited with driving major stock indexes to all-time highs.

What rubbish this whole scam is getting to be and it¡¯s all from the instability that keeps mounting as the seconds tick away and the fight to keep it at bay which will in the end be a futile effort. The walking back scenario (take a bow Ben) is in full bloom and now from something like this that was clearly not part of his original statement. I have to believe that this tool is a part of the final act of desperation, ill fated as it is, to fasten together what is slowly becoming unglued and falling apart.

Chinese economic growth in absolute terms is not slowing down. According to the IMF, China¡¯s GDP in 2008 was $4.5 trillion. At 10% growth, $450 billion was added to China¡¯s economy in 2008. At the beginning of 2013, China¡¯s economy was $8.2 trillion. At 7.5% growth, $615 billion will be added to China¡¯s economy this year. $615 billion growth (in 2013 at 7.5%) > $450 billion growth (in 2008 at 10%) Real absolute economic growth today in China is larger than it was five years ago.
