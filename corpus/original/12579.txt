(Reuters) - Benchmark spot prices of iron ore in China, the world's biggest consumer, surged to $110 a tonne on Thursday, traders and industry consultancy Mysteel said, 10 percent higher than a week earlier due to strong local demand.
Indian ore of 63/63.5 percent iron content for future delivery was quoted at $110 a tonne, including freight costs, while some ores for immediate delivery were bid at more than 900 yuan ($131.8) a tonne, Mysteel said.
Trade sources in China confirmed the prices but pointed out that sentiment was growing cautious, with fewer deals seen in the market today, partly because the price hikes were faster than expected.
"Many young people want to buy a flat in Shanghai, but feel mounting property prices will pressure them heavily, and do not expect sharp price cuts or demand to fall. There is a similar sentiment on iron ore right now," said a Shanghai-based trader.

Domestic steel prices have been surging in recent weeks, fuelled by strong demand from the construction sector as the economy recovers, although concerns are mounting that prices may be climbing beyond what industry fundamentals can support.
