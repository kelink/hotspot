(Reuters) - The dollar rallied from a 15-month low against major currencies on Wednesday in a technical rebound after selling pressure failed to push the U.S. currency through key levels.
Until its recovery, the dollar was down for most of the session, hurt by downbeat views by Federal Reserve officials on the U.S. economy and bullish economic data from China that bolstered risk appetite.

"It was a technical failure to break through the old lows on the dollar," said Joseph Trevisani, senior market analyst at FX Solutions in Saddle River, New Jersey. "It's still looking lower but it is going to take a stronger push for the dollar to get through on the downside."
Midway through the New York session, the dollar index was up 0.1 percent at 75.119 .DXY after going as low as 74.774, its lowest since August 2008, despite the gains against the pound.
was down 0.1 percent at $1.4972, falling from a session high of $1.5048, according to Reuters data. The euro faces key resistance against the dollar around $1.5060, Trevisani said. (Reporting by Nick Olivari; Editing by Leslie Adler)
