METALS-Copper steady, fund buying offsets weak U.S. data
2009-11-06 10:07:00.0
(Reuters) - Copper was steady on Friday as bargain hunting by funds offset demand worries linked to worse than expected employment data in the United States, the world's largest economy.
Copper for three-month delivery MCU3 on the London Metal Exchange traded at $6,555 a tonne at 1450 GMT from $6,530 at the close on Thursday, and compared with a session low of $6,440.50.
The Labor Department said on Friday U.S employers cut a more-than-expected 190,000 jobs last month, taking the unemployment rate to 10.2 percent, the highest in 26-1/2 years. [ID:nN06178752]
The dollar initially rose against the euro after the data, making dollar-priced metals more expensive for non-U.S. investors. It later gave back all of it gains. [FRX/]
"Copper has been hit by a double whammy - one a weak economy meaning weak demand, and secondly a strengthening dollar," said Calyon analyst Robin Bhar.
"But it may be viewed as a buying opportunity by investors who think if the economy is weak, the Fed has to keep rates low and that will mean overall a weak dollar." Earlier this session, copper benefitted from data showing German manufacturing orders rose in September on firmer foreign demand. [ID:nL5533743]
"Both German manufacturing orders data and the OECD Leading Indicator data released today support the recovery thesis," said David Thurtell, an analyst at Citigroup. "Although metal prices have priced the recovery in to a large extent."
Copper prices have more than doubled this year, driven by strong investment interest, a weak dollar and record imports from China, the world's largest industrial metals consumer.
LME copper stocks continue to rise, however, indicating demand has yet to recover outside China. Latest data showed stocks rose 5,750 tonnes to total 385,575 -- their highest since early May.
Copper stocks in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose 1 percent from a week earlier to 104,275 tonnes, the highest since late April, 2004.[ID:nSHA221465] "Fundamentals remain uncertain," said Francois Lauras, credit analyst at Moody's. "Demand has been supported by China but ... the Western economies haven't really picked up."
Aluminium MAL3 was flat at $1,925. LME stocks of the metal, used in transport and packaging, eased 3,275 tonnes but remained near record levels at 4.54 million tonnes.
