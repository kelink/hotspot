Reuters reported last week that GNPC was still interested in buying Kosmos Energy's stake in the giant Jubilee oil field, citing a GNPC source.
The GNPC source indicated the Ghanaian company could ultimately sell on any interest gained, while a separate source close to the matter said GNPC's desire for a role "can be accommodated."
