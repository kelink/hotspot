China's stock regulator announced late on Friday that it would review an application this week by Metallurgical Corp of China for a Shanghai IPO aiming to raise 16.85 billion yuan ($2.5 billion), while approving a Shanghai IPO by train maker China CNR Corp to raise nearly $1 billion.
The index had managed a rebound in the final two days of last week after falling 20 percent over a two-week period, as a 90 percent rally since the start of the year stalled amid concerns about stretched valuations, tightening market liquidity and fresh supplies of equity in the market.
The pull-back in large part also reflected Chinese corporations pulling money out of the market as they shifted bank borrowings from short-term investments into longer-term projects. [ID:nSP424264] (Reporting by Lu Jianxin and Edmund Klamann; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
