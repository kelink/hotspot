Chi Mei on Tuesday said it expected its TV panel shipments to grow 25-30 percent in the second quarter from the first, and that monitor panel shipments should grow at the same pace over the period, while laptop panel shipments would rise 35-40 percent in the period.
Chi Mei, whose TV business made up 55 percent of its total revenue in the first quarter, projected TV and monitor panel prices in the second quarter would rise between 5-15 percent from the first quarter. By comparison, AU forecast its panel shipments would rise by about 50 percent sequentially in the second quarter as it could run at almost full capacity in the second quarter. [ID:nTP38557]

Chi Mei said its capacity utilisation rate would rise to 85 percent in the second quarter from the first quarter's 55-60 percent.
On the same day, Chi Mei reported a first-quarter loss of T$19.6 billion ($580 million), its third straight quarter of loss.
