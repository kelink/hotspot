(Reuters) - Global stocks and crude oil ended lower on Monday, on fresh concerns about economic recovery, helping to revive a safety bid for the U.S. dollar
The U.S. dollar bounced from 14-month lows seen last week on speculation that a credit for first-time U.S. homebuyers credit will be phased out, and a rising dollar meant investors scaled back commodity holdings after a rally for raw goods.

"You do have an overall reversal in risk appetite," said Samarjit Shankar, managing director of global FX strategy at BNY Mellon in Boston.

U.S. financial shares tumbled after investment researchers ISI Group said in a research note that there could be an agreement to phase out the home buyer tax credit over 13 months, rather than expand it, as some had hoped.
Several traders attributed the about-face in U.S. stocks, which had been about 1.0 percent higher, to ISI's research note.
"Anything that stops the printing press is going to help the dollar," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. But "any time you pull away a bailout, the market doesn't like it," he said.
