(Reuters) - The dollar touched a one-month low against sterling on Wednesday and the euro broke above the $1.50 level for the first time in 14 months as expectations for low U.S. interest rates weighed on the greenback.
Analysts said that suggests central banks outside the United States are considering winding down programs that have flooded their economies with money. If the U.S. Federal Reserve doesn't follow suit and holds interest rates at record lows, that would diminish investor desire to hold dollars.

Against a basket of currencies, the dollar .DXY hit a fresh 14-month low of 74.94. Whether the euro, the biggest component of the basket, pushes higher depends to some extent on U.S. stocks and crude oil futures, which broke above $81 a barrel on Wednesday.
The dollar and commodities are often inversely correlated, with gold and oil priced in dollars and seen as an alternative currency and hard asset themselves.
"Before we say the floodgates have opened, we have to see whether gains in the S&P 500 and oil are going to accelerate as quickly," said Andrew Chaveriat, technical analyst at BNP Paribas in New York. A euro move to around $1.5070 could spark profit-taking and a temporary retreat, he added.
