Nearly 300,000 children fell ill last year after drinking milk intentionally laced with melamine, a toxic industrial compound that can give a fake positive on protein tests, sold mainly by the now bankrupt Sanlu Group.
The official Xinhua news agency, citing a court statement, said Zhang Yujun was executed "for the crime of endangering public safety by dangerous means," while Geng Jinping was convicted of producing and selling toxic food.
It said Zhang produced more than 770 tonnes of melamine-laced protein powder, of which he sold more than 600 tonnes, between July 2007 and August 2008.
Geng sold more than 900 tonnes of tainted milk, Xinhua added.
Many families of poisoned children had focused their anger on Sanlu's former general manager, Tian Wenhua, and said at the time they felt betrayed that she would not face execution.
Xinhua said she had lodged an appeal, but that it had been turned down by the court.
The case was the latest in a string of food safety failures, but the Sanlu milk scandal was also one of the worst and prompted an outpouring of public anger.
Melamine, which can cause kidney stones, is meant to be used in making plastics, fertilizers and even concrete. Its high nitrogen content allows protein levels to appear higher when it is added to milk or animal feed.
