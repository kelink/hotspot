(Reuters) - A U.S. Treasury Department report examining whether key trade partners like China unfairly manipulate their currencies' values was due on Thursday, though the Treasury wouldn't confirm it will be released.
While the Treasury said in April that it considered China's yuan undervalued in light of China's huge trade surpluses and foreign exchange reserves, it didn't estimate what level it felt the yuan
U.S. trade groups continue urging the Obama administration to take a tougher line with China on currency, claiming Beijing gets an unfair advantage by keeping its goods prices artificially low, in the process putting American factories and workers out of business.
But Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has been trying to encourage China to help "rebalance" the global economy by consuming more and exporting less and has praised Beijing's economic stimulus package, playing down currency issues.
Under the 1988 U.S. law that requires semiannual reports to Congress, Treasury is required to "initiate negotiations ... on an expedited basis, in the International Monetary Fund or bilaterally" with any country that it cites for currency manipulation.
China was cited in five reports between May 1992 and July 1994 but no country has been cited since then. (Reporting by Glenn Somerville; Editing by Andrea Ricci)
