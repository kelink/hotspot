(Reuters) - China will host an extra round of international negotiations in October aimed at fostering agreement over a new climate treaty, the United Nations' top environment official said in remarks published on Monday.
Achim Steiner, a U.N. Under-Secretary General who is director of the U.N. Environment Program, told the China Daily the extra round of negotiations would take place in the north Chinese port city of Tianjin, which is close to Beijing.
"China will introduce some new ideas and opportunities to move the negotiation forward," said Steiner, who has been visiting China.
The newly added Tianjin talks will come in the build-up to the next major ministerial meeting in Cancun, Mexico, from November 29-December 10, when climate officials hope to agree on the key elements of a new treaty, if not the details.
China is the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases from human activities, having outpaced the United States, and its position on controlling emissions will be crucial in efforts to build a new pact on fighting global warming.
In May, Xie Zhenhua, who led China's delegation to the stormy negotiations in Copenhagen, said the only target for the gathering in Cancun was a "positive result."
