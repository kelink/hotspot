(Reuters) - Everbright Bank, fortified by record earnings in 2008, hopes to go ahead with its long-planned IPO next year and is talking to potential domestic investors about a capital injection prior to going public.
The bank filed a new initial public offering application with the China Securities Regulatory Commission on March 31, replacing the one lodged last June, Lin Li, the bank's board secretary, said on Monday.
"If I give you a broad timetable, I think we'll be able to go public next year," Lin told reporters after Everbright's annual general meeting.
The poor performance of the stock market and weak investor sentiment thwarted the plans of the Beijing-based private bank to go public in 2008, but Lin said Everbright had not paused in its preparations.
"We've been waiting for the appropriate time and a final decision by the regulator," he said.
Net profit rose 45.2 percent in 2008 to 7.32 billion yuan ($1.07 billion), the best result in the bank's 16-year history. It distributed 2.16 billion yuan in dividends, the first payout in five years.
To meet the regulatory requirements for its IPO, Everbright aimed to increase its capital adequacy ratio to 10 percent by the end of this year from 8.8 percent at the end of March, Lin said.
Everbright has been in talks with several domestic firms about injecting new capital, he said. The bank was looking to bring in influential organizations with strong balance sheets, a good social image and a long-term commitment.
"We'll start looking for (foreign) strategic investors when the timing is appropriate," he said. "But there is no timetable for that."
