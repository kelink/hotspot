(Reuters) - China's auto market, which overtook the United States as the world's largest earlier this year thanks to a raft of policy incentives, has been a major bright spot amid a global industry downturn.
Following are some key facts about China's car industry:
In the first 11 months, a total of 9.23 million passenger cars were sold in the country, up 49.70 percent from a year earlier, data provided by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers showed.
SAIC-GM-Wuling led the market with 902,507 vehicles sold during the Jan-Nov period. The firm is a joint venture between General Motors, SAIC Motor Corp, China's largest car maker, and Liuzhou Wuling Automobile.
Shanghai Volkswagen, a joint venture between Volkswagen AG and SAIC, followed with total sales of 640,620 units.
FAW Volkswagen, the German automaker's tie-up with state-owned FAW Group, sold 616,509 units in the first 11 months of 2009, ranking third.
BYD's F3 sedan was the best selling car in China in the first 11 months of 2009. The Shenzhen-based battery and car maker, backed by U.S. billionaire Warren Buffet, sold 21,853 units of F3 in the period.
