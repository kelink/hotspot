Copper prices rebounded from early losses after China's president, Xi Jinping, in remarks published on Tuesday, emphasized the government's determination to restructure the country's slowing economy. Yields on low-risk U.S. and German government debt rose as higher equity prices reduced their safe-haven appeal.
Oil prices also rose on optimism on China, as did shares of mining companies. Local media in China reported the government was looking to increase investment in railroad projects to help relieve a capacity glut in steel, cement and other construction projects.
"Managing to keep (Chinese growth) above 7 percent will certainly be viewed as a positive stance," said IG Markets analyst Alastair McCaig in London.

U.S. shares will likely struggle to extend their winning streak unless there are more upbeat earnings and economic developments, analysts said.
"Valuations are decent, there's positive monetary pressure, earnings are just OK... It's hard to get people excited but the market keeps grinding higher," said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York.

China is in gold buying frenzy. Physical deliveries at Shanghai Gold Exchange this year were 1200 tons, imports from Hongkong 500+ tons. They also have domestic production of 400 tons. Public can¡¯t buy such amounts of gold for jewellery and investment. Only 1H 2013 apparent consumption will be enough to buy 2 rings to every Chinese lady. PBOC is buying in a diversification out of USD and EUR assets. With 3,4 trillion reserves, 10% diversification means 8000 tons (or 260 million oz if you don¡¯t like metric system).

The next step will be change of reserve currency from USD to RMB, not now, but in 10-15 years.
I like US dollar, we can live with US hegemony, it is only 300 million people with insatiable resources demand. We do not know what insatiable resources demand of 1400 milion means. FED can choose when to taper and everybody is listening, but sometimes around 2020 nobody would care so at maximum 10 years of zero interests rates fantasy.

China claims that it will keep its growth target at 7.5%, and its GDP growth for the first half of 2013 is at 7.6%. In the current and next 5 year plans from 2011 to 2020, China will develop the center, north, and west as it has done for the eastern and southern provinces that lie near the coasts. China¡¯s total foreign trade rose 8.6% in the first half of 2013; exports rose 10.4%; and imports rose 6.7%. This has happened while the EU, China¡¯s biggest trade partner is in recession with negative growth, and the US, its 2nd biggest trade partners struggles. Fortunately, China¡¯s trade with ASEAN, its 3rd biggest partner, rose 12.2% in the 1st half of 2013, and the numbers for Africa, its 4th biggest partner, should be similary good. China has made a point of increasing trade with developing nations to create a cushion when the major powers suffer economically.
