Zimbabwe issues license to banned newspaper

(Reuters) - Zimbabwean authorities on Thursday issued an operating license to a local newspaper group forced to close down by the state five years ago, a move which suggests the new unity government intends to open up the media.
The government is setting up a new Zimbabwe Media Commission to spearhead the reforms, including easing restrictive registration and accreditation requirements for media.
In a letter to the ANZ directors, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, the committee which was considering the application said the newspaper group was free to operate again.
The ANZ group used to publish a private daily newspaper and a weekly on Sunday, sharply critical of Mugabe's rule, and in competition with a government-controlled newspaper group.
In the face of a political crisis blamed on his ZANU-PF party, Mugabe adopted tough media laws in 2002 which made it difficult for the local private and foreign media to work in the southern African country.
