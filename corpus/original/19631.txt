(Reuters) - Denmark's Novo Nordisk (
) said on Friday it was in constructive dialogue with U.S. regulators on its key new diabetes drug, Victoza, a day after the European Medicines Agency recommended its approval.
Earlier this month, a U.S. advisory panel cast doubt on the diabetes drug's safety, and now the final decision on approval rests with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Investors fear that the agency will delay or even block a U.S. launch.
"We are in a constructive dialogue with the FDA, but whether they will take any direction from a European decision, we don't know," said Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, chief science officer at Novo Nordisk, which is the world's biggest maker of insulin.

The drug company said that if it receives approval in two months' time as expected, it would be able to launch the drug in some European countries during the summer.
Krogsgaard Thomsen said an EU go-ahead would make the drug's outlook rosier on several other markets, such as China.
"The European approval opens up for approval in a number of other countries all over the world. In many countries an approval of a new product depends on European approval," he said.
He said that in China, companies are only allowed to apply for new drug approval once it has been approved in the producer's home market. (Writing by Anna Ringstrom and Ben Hirschler; Editing by David Cowell)
