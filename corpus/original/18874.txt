The head of Libya's National Oil Co has repeatedly stated plans to exercise its rights to match a C$499 million ($427 million), or C$10 per share, bid for Verenex made by CNPC's international arm made in February. [ID:nLQ630159]
However Verenex, which operates in part of Libya's Ghadames Basin, where it has made several oil discoveries, said in a release that Libya has not presented an offer.
"The Chairman of the NOC has publicly stated that the NOC intends to exercise a pre-emptive right and purchase all the shares of Verenex at C$10 per share," the company said in a statement included in its first-quarter earnings release. "Such intent has not as yet been formally communicated to Verenex and CNPC."
