FOREX-Dollar recovers from 14-month low vs euro

(Reuters) - The dollar recovered from a 14-month low against a basket of currencies in volatile trading on Tuesday as policymakers in Europe and Asia commented on the greenback's decline and options-related buying kept it from pushing though key levels.
Concern about U.S. currency weakness also prompted the Bank of Canada to leave interest rates at record lows, driving the U.S. dollar up more than 2 percent against its Canadian counterpart.
Wall Street also fell as weak U.S. inflation and housing data offset strong quarterly earnings, denting investor appetite to sell the low-yielding dollar in favor of higher-yielding currencies more closely correlated with economic recovery. For more on U.S. data, see [ID:nN20424995]
The dollar has been under sustained pressure this year as investors brace for record low U.S. interest rates to last well into 2010 and questions mount about its status as the world's main reserve currency.
"The market was long overdue for a correction, but we'll have to wait a few days to see if there's any follow-through from this," said Steven Butler, head of FX trading at Scotia Capital in Toronto. "If the euro gets back to $1.48, that's probably still an opportunity to buy it at better levels."
An index that measures the dollar against six major currencies recovered from a 14-month low at 75.103 and was last up 0.2 percent at 75.643 .DXY. The euro, the biggest component in that basket, was off 0.4 percent at $1.4909
The dollar earlier fell as low as 90.08 yen but recovered to 91.07 yen, up 0.5 percent from late on Monday, with the critical dollar/yen support level for investors at 90.0 yen. The dollar was last at 90.75 yen, up 0.1 percent on the day.
Just last week, the dollar fell to a 15-month low near C$1.02. It last traded up 2 percent at C$1.0494.
Recent dollar weakness has also unnerved European and Asian officials, who fear their own currency strength will undermine economic recovery. Henri Guaino, a top adviser to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, on Tuesday said a euro at $1.50 is a "disaster" for European industry and the economy.
But until the market hears stronger rhetoric from the likes of European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, low U.S. rates, coupled with rising asset and commodity prices, will probably continue to weigh on the dollar, analysts say.
"It's one thing to say you want the dollar to stop weakening, it's another to put your money where your mouth is," said Peter Frank, senior strategist at Societe Generale in London. "The market isn't there yet, and won't take notice until it hears this kind of commentary more and from higher ranking officials."
