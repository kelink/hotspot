METALS-Equity selling undermines copper's early gains
2009-05-12 17:12:00.0
(Reuters) - Copper slipped late on Tuesday, settling slightly lower in New York as selling in U.S. equity markets undermined an early rally for the red metal.
Copper for July delivery HGN9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX settled 0.25 cent lower at $2.0860 a lb after reaching an early high of $2.1550 a lb. When copper settled, Wall Street stocks were lower as investors took profits in technology and banking. Later, the Dow Jones industrial average recovered to close with slight gains but other stock indexes closed lower.
Steep dollar losses had helped propel copper to the high end of its recent trading band. Later in the session, the dollar extended losses to a four-month low as improved risk appetite put broad-based pressure on the U.S. currency. [USD/]
Copper MCU3 for three-months delivery on the London Metal Exchange was at $4,595/4,600 a tonne at the close, up from Monday's close of $4,565 a tonne but off the session high of $4,717 a tonne.
Data showing robust investment spending in China, the world's top copper consumer, gave copper a boost.
China reported overnight that it imported more copper than ever before in April as traders capitalised on Beijing's efforts to stockpile metal and on apparently growing demand, revived by a credit boom and increased state investment. [nHKG272336]
But gains were capped as analysts raised doubts about whether China would maintain its strong appetite for imports amid a sharp fall in the country's exports. [ID:nPEK146927]
"The concern out there right now is that, given that we're in a seasonally slack demand period, if that Asian buying were to subside copper would be vulnerable to further selloffs," said David Meger, metals analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago.
He added that copper's latest gains on prospects for economic improvement could be undermined easily if Asian buying disappears, especially in China.
"People are cautiously bullish. So when you see days like today when equity markets are under pressure copper can be very sensitive," said Meger.

"What's happening is there's a general push into riskier assets which is lifting everything in commodities and copper's benefiting from that," said analyst Dan Smith at Standard Chartered.
Chinese trade data also showed April's aluminium imports jumped three-fold to 440,000 tonnes while investment spending surged 30 percent. [ID:nLC559008]
"Our economists believe that the jump in investment reflects the impact of the stimulus package and other supportive industrial policies rolled out by the government since last November," Barclays Capital said in a research note.
But the data raised eyebrows as well, with weak exports begging the question of how long China could support the world copper market.
"The market is already assuming that (Chinese) imports will be winding down now because imports were so high, scrap is more readily available," said Stephen Briggs, analyst at RBS Global Banking & Markets.
Inventories continued to fall. Stocks of copper dropped by 6,150 tonnes while cancelled warrants -- material earmarked for delivery -- climbed to 74,500 tonnes from 70,350 tonnes on Monday.
Steel making ingredient nickel MNI3 rallied nearly 5 percent to $13,550 a tonne, helped by news on BHP Billiton (

Aluminium MAL3 firmed to $1,546/1,547 from $1,539 while zinc MZN3 closed at $1,545 from $1,542 and battery material lead MPB3 rallied to $1,475 from $1,426. Tin's MSN3 supply worries lifted it to $14,025 from $13,900 previously.
