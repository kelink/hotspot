(Reuters) - China Huaneng Group, the nation's biggest electricity producer, is in advanced talks to buy a 50 percent stake in U.S.-based power utility InterGen NV for about $1.2 billion, Bloomberg reported, citing two people with knowledge of the matter.
The stake would give China Huaneng access to InterGen's 12 power plants in the U.K., the Netherlands, Mexico, Australia and the Philippines, the report said.
), an Indian builder of roads and airports, are still being negotiated, the report said.
The deal may be valued at as much as $1.4 billion, including payments for taking over some non-operating assets, one of the sources said.
The transaction would be China Huaneng's largest overseas purchase since it bought Singapore's Tuas Power Ltd. for $3.1 billion in March 2008.
GMR Infrastructure, based in Bangalore, bought 50 percent of InterGen in 2008 for $1.1 billion from a fund owned by American International Group Inc. The rest of InterGen is owned by Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan.
