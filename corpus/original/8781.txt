The Commerce Department began its investigation earlier this month upon accepting a petition filed by U.S. Steel, V&M Star LP, TMK IPSCO and the United Steelworkers union.
President Barack Obama angered China last month by imposing a 35 percent duty on Chinese-made tires in response to a petition from the Steelworkers union, which also represents workers at many U.S. tire plants.
The latest case involves seamless carbon and alloy steel standard, line and pressure pipe used in industrial piping systems to convey water, steam, oil products, natural gas and other liquids and gases.
Imports of the product from China increased nearly 132 percent by volume from 2006 to 2008 to an estimated $382 million, the Commerce Department said.
A Commerce Department investigation of the Chinese pipe imports will determine the size of the duties to be imposed. For the duties to become final, the ITC must vote next year that U.S. producers are threatened by the imports.
