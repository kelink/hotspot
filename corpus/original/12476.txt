(Reuters) - Global investors poured $9.56 billion into equity funds in the week ended Aug 5, the highest weekly inflow into the sector so far this year, fund tracker EPFR Global said on Friday.
Positive earnings news and largely-upbeat economic data, remain the main drivers of stocks globally with the MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS posting a 10-month high this month.
That has pushed down the appeal of low-yielding, safe-haven cash holdings and money funds continued to see withdrawals with risk tolerance remaining high.
Investors took $24 billion out of money market funds, taking the year-to-date outflows to well over $200 billion.
Developed markets accounted for $8 billion of the global equity inflows, and Asia ex-Japan attracted the most funds among the four major EPFR global-tracked emerging market equity fund groups during the first week of August.
After a 15 percent gain in July, the highest monthly rise since the height of the 2007 bull market, the Shanghai Composite index
This is reflected in the flows with China equity funds taking in a net $18 million compared with $45 million for Russia equity funds, $89 million for Brazil equityfFunds and $125 million for India equity funds.
European equities attracted $964 million, the most since the second week of May, and the Japanese equities sector remained a net receiver for the sixth straight week, the best run since the late second quarter of 2008.
Fixed-income funds continued to attract inflows despite rising debt supplies, with the sector extending its streak to 17 weeks or more.
Overall, 20 of the 24 major equity, sector and fixed income fund groups tracked by EPFR Global posted inflows. (Reporting by Umesh Desai; Editing by Chris Lewis)
