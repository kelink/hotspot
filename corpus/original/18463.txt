(Reuters) - Australian iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group Ltd (
) on Tuesday doused speculation it was seeking a listing on the Shanghai stock exchange anytime soon, citing restrictions placed by regulators on foreign companies.
"Given existing restrictions on foreign company listings and other related regulatory approval processes, such an action is not a current proposition," Fortescue said in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, where the company has long held a listing.
Fortescue shares dropped 7.8 percent to A$2.83 after the announcement, returning more than half the 16 percent gain seen on Monday.
Analysts have suggested such a move could make sense for Fortescue, given the company sells ore to more than two dozen steel mills in China and is partly owned by Valin.
Hunan Valin was recently cleared by foreign investment regulators in Australia to take up a 17.55 percent direct interest in Fortescue, the world's No.4 iron ore miner.
The move to a listing in China would also coincide with plans by the Shanghai bourse to permit foreign listings under an ambitious development scheme, the China News Agency reported. (Reporting by James Regan)
