"The sentiment is not that of panic but that of caution. There is no indication on how bad the situation may get, so investors are guarded about taking new positions," said Alex Wong, director with Ample Finance Group.
"Though Hong Kong has the SARS experience behind it, there are fears that this swine flu may be different and could potentially do more damage" he said.
