(Reuters) - The dollar rose broadly on Monday as a drop in oil prices late last week prompted investors to buy the greenback and take profits from recent gains in commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian dollar.
Traders said the outcome of the Group of Eight finance ministers' meeting at the weekend did not offer any surprises and the focus has shifted to oil and stocks for near-term direction.
The G8 nations, heartened by signs the credit crisis is easing, have started to consider how to unwind rescue steps for their economies, their finance ministers said on Saturday. [ID:nL5701713]
"The G8, as expected, did not lay out the details of the exit strategies for their crisis policies," said Kosuke Hanao, head of treasury product sales at HSBC in Tokyo.
"What lifted the dollar last week was the drop in oil prices. But it remains to be seen whether such moves in oil and the dollar will continue as the main factors" affecting the market, Hanao said.
The dollar drew some support from comments from Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, who said the dollar's role as the world's main reserve currency is unlikely to change in the near future. [ID:nFCA000184]
Kudrin's remarks came ahead of the first summit of leaders of Russia, China, India and Brazil on Tuesday in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, at which the leaders are expected to discuss issues including foreign reserve diversification.
But leaders of the so-called BRIC nations do not plan to discuss prospects for new global reserve currencies at their meeting, a top Kremlin aide said, easing some concerns about the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency.
