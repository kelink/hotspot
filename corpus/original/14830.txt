Teck, a top miner of zinc, copper, and metallurgical coal, will sell 101.3 million shares at C$17.21 each, a 7 percent discount to Thursday's closing Toronto-listed price of C$18.50.
In a statement, Teck Chief Executive Don Lindsay said the transaction was "an attractive opportunity for Teck to establish a relationship with a major Chinese financial investor."
Teck said CIC, a sovereign wealth fund, has said it is acquiring the shares as a long-term passive financial investors and has agreed to hold the stock for at least a year after closing.
Vancouver, British Columbia-based Teck will use the proceeds of the deal to cut bank debt. The miner took on nearly $10 billion in debt last year to buy Fording Canadian Coal Trust, which made it a top producer of metallurgical coal, or coal used in the steelmaking process.
The company has sold some assets to pay down the debt, and has said it planned to sell a 20 percent stake in its coal business. Lindsay has said the company has seen strong demand for coal out of China, which is overhauling its steel industry.
