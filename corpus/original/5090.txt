(Reuters) - The corporate espionage scandal embroiling Renault, with the French government probing a possible link to China [ID:nLDE7060RP), is only the latest example of government-linked corporate espionage.
French intelligence is looking into a possible Chinese role in spying on carmaker Renault, a government source told Reuters on Friday. Three executives, including one of its management committee, were suspended on Monday in the case suspected of leaking material on the electric vehicle program in which Renault and partner Nissan have invested billions.
U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks show U.S. diplomats believe hacking attacks on Google that briefly prompted the company to pull out from China were orchestrated by two members of the country's ruling body.
Citing the cables, the New York Times reported that China had made repeated and often successful hacking attacks on the U.S. government, private enterprises and Western allies as far back as 2002.
Google closed its China-based search service in March, two months after it said it would stop censoring search results, in response to what it said was a sophisticated cyber attack traced to China. The dispute was resolved in July after Google tweaked the way it directs users to an unfiltered search engine.
WIKILEAKS AND BANK OF AMERICA?
Having released the entire U.S. military war logs for the Iraqi and Afghan campaigns and slowly releasing some 250,000 classified diplomatic cables, Wikileaks' next release is widely expected to center on Bank of America Corp.
Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has not named the bank as the target of the next release, but he said in a 2009 interview the group had five gigabytes of documents and data from the hard drive of one of the bank's executives.
in 2007, a Chinese student doing a work placement at car parts maker Valeo was given a prison sentence for obtaining confidential documents from the automaker. A French tribunal stopped short of an industrial espionage verdict, instead finding that she had "abused trust"
Analysts suspect China and other emerging powers have long been targeting U.S. defense secrets, which may in part explain why China is seen increasingly closing the technology gap with the West.
Images posted on a number of websites and published by the Wall Street Journal appeared to show a working prototype of a Chinese J-20 Stealth fighter, although U.S. officials said it believed Beijing was still years from a working model.
But information theft could help Beijing closed the gap with Lockheed Martin's F-22 raptor, the world's only operational Stealth fighter or its successor the F-35.
In his 2010 book "Cyber War," former George W.Bush White House cyber security chief Richard Clarke said he believes hackers had stolen information on the F-35 equal to 10 complete multivolume copies of Encyclopedia Britannica.
"If a Cold War spy wanted to move that much information out of a secret, classified facility, he would have needed a small moving van and a forklift," he wrote.
From the days of the Tsarist secret police, Russian security agencies have had a reputation for closely monitoring foreigners. Security experts say many hotel rooms are fitted with bugs and outside corporates should be extremely wary about what information they take into the country.
"In Russia, journalists are well aware their e-mail is intercepted," says Ian Bremmer, president of political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. "Given the amount of money involved, there will always be someone spying on foreign corporates. There's not much that can be done other than to write e-mails knowing they could be stolen."
