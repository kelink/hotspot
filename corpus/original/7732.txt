(Reuters) - Copper prices ended lower on Thursday, weighed down by a slight rebound in the U.S. dollar and growing concerns about demand weakness after London stockpile levels broke above 400,000 tonnes.
Nickel MNI3 inventories on the London Metal Exchange (LME) rose above 131,700 tonnes, the highest since early 1995, driving prices of the metal down more than 5 percent to their lowest since late July.
Copper for December delivery HGZ9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division shed 1.85 cents to end at $2.9475 a lb, near the lower end of its $2.93 to $3.0010 session range.
LME copper for three-month delivery MCU3 finished down $37 at $6,503 a tonne from $6,540 at the close on Wednesday and compared with a session low at $6,468.
John Gross, publisher of the Copper Journal, said that despite the bearish fundamental backdrop in the copper market, prices remained locked in a higher trend.
"Forget about the fundamentals ... the price trend has been up and a trend is going to remain in place until something occurs to change it. The rising inventories has not changed it and the weakness in demand has not changed it," he said.
LME copper stocks climbed 4,800 tonnes to total 402,125 -- the highest since late April, indicating demand has yet to recover outside China.
"This build in inventory illustrates the fact that the physical market is looking a lot less supportive on the demand side," said Daniel Brebner, metals analyst at Deutsche Bank.
Those demand concerns were echoed by the chief executive of the world's second-biggest copper producer, Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold (

"The whole LME complex reacts to macro news and equity markets, optimism is still there, the dollar is relatively weak despite today's rebound ... but the upside is capped by fundamentals," said Andrey Kryuchenkov, analyst at VTB Capital.

Investors are taking increasing note of industrial disputes at mines, which could support prices and give indicators for future labor talks.
"It's one of many," said Marc Elliott, an analyst at investment bank Fairfax on Konkola. "Negotiations in South American miners are under way ... it is all lending some support to prices at the moment."
