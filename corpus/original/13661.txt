"There certainly are hopes for change but more important than that is the Democratic Party actually showing that they'll be able to carry out change."
Over the longer term, worries about how the Democrats would fund their proposed social programmes could weigh on the market, analysts said. Most of the Nikkei's gains came as it moved to play catch-up after a holiday on Monday.

"If and when we do break above it, though, this is likely to become support, with a spate of buying sending the Nikkei higher, perhaps quickly," said Nagayuki Yamagishi, a strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities.
