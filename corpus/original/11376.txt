The 37-year-old South Korean, who became the first Asian man to win a major by out-dueling world number one Woods in Minnesota this month, will return to Shanghai for the November 5-8 tournament, now a World Golf Championship (WGC) event.
Yang is a former champion at the Sheshan International Golf Club, having stormed up the leaderboard in the final round of the tournament in 2006 to beat Woods by two strokes.
"Winning the tournament set the foundation for bigger things to come," he said in a statement released by organizers. "It gave me the courage to achieve bigger goals."
Spain's 2008 champion Sergio Garcia and world number two Phil Mickelson, who won the 2007 version, will also return to the course outside China's economic capital.
"After the Open Championship, it's hard to think of a bigger or better tournament held outside the U.S.," said Mickelson.
With Britain's Paul Casey, regular China visitor Henrik Stenson of Sweden, Australian Geoff Ogilvy and American Stewart Cink all signed up, the tournament will boast seven of the current top 10 players in the world.
