Yuan falls vs dollar, but trades above mid-point

(Reuters) - Spot yuan fell slightly against the dollar on Friday, but still traded above the mid-point set by the People's Bank of China as the dollar .DXY dropped 0.6 percent in global markets on Thursday.
The market mostly expects more yuan appreciation, dealers said, but as the Chinese currency had already risen quickly during the G20 meeting, it was likely to hover around recent levels in the near term.
"It has appreciated a lot recently under international pressure. Now it's time for the yuan to have a rest," said a dealer at a European bank in Shanghai. "But we still expect that the yuan will continue to appreciate in the future."
Spot yuan was trading at 6.6367 versus the dollar by midday, down from Thursday's close of 6.6336 but was still up 2.86 percent since the PBOC announced a depegging of the two currencies in mid-June.
It moved in a small range of 6.6352 to 6.8385, trading above the central bank's daily mid-point of 6.6408, stronger than Thursday's 6.6455. The mid-point or reference rate is a level from where the yuan can rise or fall 0.5 percent in a day.
Dealers said that in the long term, the yuan's appreciation was an inevitable trend as China needs to fight against imported inflation amid surging commodity prices and cushion capital inflows including those from trade and foreign direct investment.
And dealers still expect China to let the yuan touch 6.6 per dollar at some point this year, possibly when the U.S. Treasury prepares to publish its twice-yearly currency report that was delayed from mid-October and could name China as a currency manipulator.
"Rising inflation is a serious problem," the European bank dealer said. "We cannot rule out the possibility that the central bank may increase the interest rate and let the yuan appreciate simultaneously in the future."
One-year NDFs rose to 6.5520 bid by midday, from 6.5450 at Thursday's close, with their implied 12-month yuan appreciation falling to 1.36 percent from 1.54 percent.
