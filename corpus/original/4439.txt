Instant view: China trade surplus bigger than expected

(Reuters) - China had a trade surplus of $11.4 billion in April, nearly four times larger than expected as exports grew markedly faster than imports.
YU SONG AND HELEN QIAO, ECONOMISTS WITH GOLDMAN SACHS:
"Import growth fell significantly on both year-on-year and sequential terms, which reflects the effects of domestic policy tightening on domestic demand as well as lower import price growth.
BRIAN JACKSON, ECONOMIST WITH ROYAL BANK OF CANADA IN HONG KONG:
"Today's trade data shows that Chinese exporters continue to benefit from a supportive exchange rate. Although the yuan is posting moderate gains against the dollar, it has lost ground against other major currencies, so in trade-weighted terms China has seen its currency weaken over the last six months or so.
"This number will likely add to the pressure from Washington for Beijing to allow faster currency appreciation, but more importantly should persuade Chinese policy-makers that a stronger yuan can be tolerated by the economy and is warranted as part of their efforts to curb price pressures."
DU ZHENGZHENG, AN ANALYST AT BOHAI SECURITIES IN BEIJING:
"The trade surplus rebounded in March and was much higher than market consensus, and I think that will probably give more ammunition for the U.S. to press for quicker yuan appreciation.
"But I think the trade surplus will continue to shrink as a share of the country's GDP, and China is seeing a more balanced trade structure."
XU BIAO, AN ECONOMIST WITH CHINA MERCHANTS BANK IN SHENZHEN:
"Imports are falling quite sharply in April, but it could not be attributed to drops in price falls. Domestic demand for imported products is weakening very sharply.
"It is unknown yet whether it would lead to a noticeable softening in domestic demand, and we have to look at domestic economic indicators to have a clearer view of the picture.
"However, concerns of a slowdown have certainly intensified, and the risks of a worst-case scenario for the Chinese economy, namely a relatively low growth rate and a high inflation, are on the rise."
HU YUEXIAO, ECONOMIST WITH SHANGHAI SECURITIES
"Import growth was slower than expected. That was mainly because high global commodities prices curbed China's demand for import.
"With global commodity prices falling, Chinese import growth may continue to ease in May, pushing up trade surplus."
TAO WANG, ECONOMIST WITH UBS IN BEIJING
"Exports are much stronger, that's the basic thing.... Global demand is still pretty strong, a bit stronger than many people feared."
"On the import side, we think that commodity exports had been very strong up until February and there has been quite a bit of inventory build-up. So right now we think it's going through some adjustment. The final demand for imports, in construction and so on, is pretty stable in China, but it is going through the inventory cycle."
