(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (
), a bellwether for the economy, is witnessing stabilisation in volumes in Europe and improvement in China and Asia, a senior executive said on Thursday.
"Volumes seem to be showing some life," Robert Elliott, chairman of the U.S company's European, Middle East and African operations told Reuters in an interview.
"It is safe to say there is a stabilisation in Europe and some positive signs on the market because companies have quickly adjusted their P&L by adjusting productivity," he said.
"We are starting also to see sequential improvements, mainly to begin with in China and Asia, which is important because that's where the large manufacturers are. Manufacturers are meanwhile boosting activity after running down inventories as the financial crisis hit confidence. Company inventories need to be replenished, Elliott said.
"The speed of the recovery will be hard to determine but we are not seeing a deteriation of volumes as we did last year," he added.
