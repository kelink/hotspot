(Reuters) - CIC Energy ELC.TO said on Friday the first power from its Mmamabula project could be delayed until early 2014 after it failed to conclude a purchase agreement with South African utility Eskom [ESCJ.UL].
"Financial close cannot happen this year as previously anticipated ... assuming that financial close would happen in early 2010, that would mean that (commercial operation date) COD would happen in early 2014," CIC President Greg Kinross said during a conference call.
Eskom told CIC it could take until the end of its financial year in March 2010 to conclude discussions with the South African government on the best funding model for the utility, which it sees as a prerequisite for any agreement with CIC.
But CIC said it was confident that Eskom, meant to receive 75 percent of the 1,320 MW gross capacity to be initially produced at the plant, would be the off-taker. The balance is meant to go to the Botswana Power Company.
"We are hoping to conclude documents (on commercial terms) that would give lenders comfort of the support of our IPP partner imminently," he said.
CIC has said that the Mmamabula coalfield on which the power plant is to be built could supply enough coal to produce up to 6,000 megawatts for more than 30 years.
