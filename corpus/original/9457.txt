(Reuters) - PC shipments in the Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan, grew 17 percent in the third quarter as laptop sales surged, and demand from China and Taiwan remained robust, research firm IDC said on Tuesday.
"Even though a lot of the momentum may be coming specifically from China, the enthusiasm should start to spread to the point where the entire region gets off on the right foot next year," Bryan Ma, Director of Asia/Pacific Personal Systems Research at IDC, said in a statement.
IDC also said the launch of Microsoft's (
) new operating system, Windows 7, could spur consumers to buy more PCs, such as low cost mini-notebooks and ultrathin notebooks.
The Asia Pacific PC shipments beat forecasts by 9 percent and grew 18 percent quarter-on-quarter, the firm said.
Global PC shipments rose 2.3 percent year on year in the third quarter, with portable personal computers a key growth driver, IDC said. [ID:nBw146393a] (Reporting by Melanie Lee; Editing by Ken Wills)
