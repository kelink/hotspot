G7 denounces FX volatility, welcomes yuan pledge

(Reuters) - The Group of Seven rich nations on Saturday said too much volatility in foreign exchange markets could hurt the global economy and financial system, and again welcomed China's pledge to move toward greater currency flexibility.
"Excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. We continue to monitor exchange markets closely, and cooperate as appropriate," the communique said.
But in the end policymakers agreed on their usual language and maintained the softer tone on China's yuan, or renminbi, first adopted in February.
"We welcome China's continued commitment to move to a more flexible exchange rate, which should lead to continued appreciation of the renminbi in effective terms and help promote more balanced growth in China and in the world economy."
G7 countries are concerned that an undervalued yuan is fueling Chinese exports at the expense of their own, contributing to an uneven global economy where Beijing runs huge trade surpluses and the United States large deficits.
There was little in the communique on the future of the G7 itself, which had been a source of much speculation after the wider G20 body -- a group that includes China and other developing economies -- declared itself the premier forum for global economic policymaking last week.
