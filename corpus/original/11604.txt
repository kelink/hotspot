(Reuters) - Copper and other industrial metals recovered from early steep declines on Wednesday, rebounding with U.S. equity markets and crude oil when data showed a surprising drop in U.S. oil stockpiles.
Oil prices surged more than 4 percent, lifting many commodities, including copper, along with it, after the latest U.S. government report showed an unexpectedly sharp slide in crude oil imports and inventories in top consumer the United States. Analysts had forecast an inventory build. [O/R]
With every category, including gasoline, falling, analysts read the series as indicating that demand was picking up.
"The data is being viewed as bullish as all stock categories fell more than expected," said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena, Illinois.

Copper for three month delivery MCU3 on the London Metal Exchange closed the ring session at $5,981 a tonne, up from a 2-1/2-week low at $5,818 a tonne.
In after hours trade, however, copper rallied up to $6,040, just short of $6,080 at Tuesday's close, boosted by investors who saw value at the early lows amid signs of demand growth.
Copper for September delivery HGU9 finished with a 0.10-cent loss at $2.7605 a lb by the close of the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division, though it had fallen as low as $2.6475, a level dating back to Aug. 3.
Earlier, copper and other metals slid when Chinese equities triggered falls across financial markets and renewed doubts about global economic health and metals demand.
"China has been supportive of commodities and if they start to pull back again and Europe and the U.S. are not ready to take up the baton then there's going to be some weakness," said Fairfax analyst Marc Elliot.

Noting that copper's early declines failed to break below a key prior low, some traders said they thought red metal prices would more likely trade in a wide sideways pattern in the near term rather than continue the latest descent.
"I've been having a debate about whether last week's highs were consolidation-type highs or whether they are a true reversal high. I have to think that what we saw today means this is just going to be a consolidation," said a New York metals trader.
