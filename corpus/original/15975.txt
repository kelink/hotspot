LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Despite the foreign launch of three big titles, including domestic box office winner "The Hangover," "Terminator Salvation" was the top pick overseas for a second weekend with estimated sales of $46.1 million from 80 territories.
A No. 1 Japan opening for the fourth title in the sci-fi action series generated $10.7 million. The film's China bow registered $9 million. In all, "Salvation" took the No. 1 spot in more than 30 territories. Its international total stands at $165.5 million.
Overall business was moderate, with torrid temperatures in many European markets complicating box office action.
"Hangover," enjoying its second weekend at No. 1 in North America, finished No. 4 overseas with $11.6 million from 15 markets. It opened at No. 1 in the U.K. ($5.2 million) and Australia ($2.7 million).
"The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3," which opened at No. 3 domestically, finished out of the top five overseas with $2.4 million, mostly from Asian and Middle Eastern markets.
Also falling short was domestic dud "Land of the Lost," with $3.1 million from five markets, led by Russia ($1.4 million, No. 2) and Australia ($1.3 million, No. 3).
Finishing second overall was Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian" with $17.9 million, raising its international haul to $176.2 million. The Ben Stiller comedy took the No. 1 spot in Mexico bow with $3.3 million.
"Up" was No. 5 with $8.2 million, leading in 12 of its 14 markets; the foreign haul for the Pixar/Disney cartoon stands at $26.6 million.
