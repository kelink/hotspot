(Reuters) - Copper prices hit their highest level since mid-October on Monday, with copper in London cracking the $5,000-a-tonne barrier, as manufacturing data from China, Europe and the United States suggested the global economy may be over the worst of the recession.
Benchmark copper MCU3 on the London Metal Exchange peaked at $5,091 a tonne, its highest level since Oct. 14, before ending the session with a $245 gain at $5,075.
"The manufacturing numbers were friendly, and you combine them with the weaker dollar, a happier equity market, and a top-side breakout, you have a recipe for a pretty solid rally," said Sterling Smith, vice president of FuturesOne in Chicago.
Copper for July delivery HGN9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division surged 12.15 cents, or 5.5 percent, to close at $2.3190 a lb, after hitting a 7-month peak at $2.3285.
An expansion in Chinese industrial activity in May, and surveys in Europe showing the manufacturing recession was easing, set the tone for industrial metals' firmer tone. [ID:nL1674940]
The rally gained momentum after the Institute of Supply Management's survey of the manufacturing industry in the United States showed the new orders index above 50 for the first time since November 2007. [ID:nN01259240]
"The data shows the stimulative measures may be working. It's taken a while to see evidence of that, but maybe that's what we're seeing at the moment," Robin Bhar, an analyst at Calyon, said.
Indications of a recovery in actual consumption are starting to appear, however, with other U.S. data showing spending on construction projects rose 0.8 percent in April from March, the biggest increase since August. [ID:nN01456282]
For now though, higher equity markets around the world should help boost metals market sentiment, as will a generally weaker dollar, which makes metals priced in the U.S. currency cheaper for holders of other currencies. [USD/] [.EU] [.N] [.T]
