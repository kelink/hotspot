Japan, China leaders to cool tensions

(Reuters) - The leaders of China and Japan met to cool bilateral tensions on Saturday, while Beijing offered Japan reassurances over its concerns about a drying-up of rare earth exports and a dispute over gas fields.
"I recognize that ties between Japan and China have taken a big step toward improvement," Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Tetsuro Fukuyama told reporters.
Hours earlier, thousands of Japanese took to the streets of Yokahama, a port city near Tokyo known for having Japan's biggest Chinatown, to protest what they see as an imperialistic China.
Sino-Japanese ties have chilled since September after Japan detained a Chinese trawler captain whose boat collided with Japanese coast guard ships near a chain of islands claimed by both countries, called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China.
The spat has taken relations between Asia's two-largest economies to their worst in five years.
The official China News Service said that Hu had met Kan, but its brief report gave no other details.
Separately, Japanese Trade Minister Akihiro Ohata said China had given reasurances that a problem over its rare earth exports would be resolved soon. He said Zhang Ping, head of the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission, had instructed officials to speed up customs inspections on rare earths.
China, which produces 97 percent of the world's rare earth metals, set its 2010 export quotas 40 percent lower than 2009 levels. Japan has been worried that China held back shipments of rare earths after the maritime dispute, though China has denied enforcing any embargo on Japan.
