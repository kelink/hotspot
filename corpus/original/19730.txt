(Adds bad loan ratio, capital adequacy ratios)
SHANGHAI, April 23
), controlled by U.S. private equity firm TPG Capital [TPG.UL], posted a 12 percent rise in first-quarter net profit on rising loan demand despite a slowing economy and shrinking interest margins.
Profit during the January-March period rose to 1.12 billion yuan ($161 million) from 1 billion yuan a year earlier, the lender said in a statement. Revenue rose 6 percent to 3.76 billion yuan from 3.55 billion yuan.
The quarterly result compares with a 77 percent slump in SDB's annual profit last year after a 5.6 billion yuan bad-loan write-off during the fourth quarter of 2008.
China has seen explosive loan growth this year as banks respond to Beijing's call to open the taps to combat the global economic slowdown. But the credit surge has also sparked fears of inflation and a build up of bad loans.
SDB, however, stuck to its strict loan approval procedures and invested surplus liquidity into low-risk bills in the interbank market, the lender said.
The capital adequacy ratio stood at 8.53 percent, lower than the 10 percent regulatory requirement for mid-sized listed lenders. (US$1=6.832 Yuan)
