(Reuters) - Kazakh oil producer Zhaikmunai (
The company, which did not specify the nature of the defaults, said it aims to refinance debt via a $300 million placement of global depository receipts, which would also help fund spending plans.
"The proceeds of the placing will be used to supplement the group's existing credit facilities and fund in part the capital expenditure programme for the Chinarevskoye field, in particular the completion of the gas treatment unit," it said in a statement.
The firm produced 7,615 barrels per day in the first quarter of this year and plans to raise output to 48,000 barrels per day in 2010 once the treatment unit is on stream.
"Zhaikmunai has continued negotiations with its existing lenders under the facility regarding potential waivers of the outstanding events of default," it said.
The GDR placing is subject to regulatory approvals, including a confirmation from the government of Kazakhstan, which has a pre-emptive right to buy into local oil firms.
