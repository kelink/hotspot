(Reuters) - Dubai-based Amara Holdings is eyeing investments in China each worth up to $200 million over the next 12 months, the latest Gulf Arab investor looking to tap opportunities in the world's most populous nation.
Amara, a sharia-compliant investment firm, said late on Wednesday it had teamed up with Ding Hai Investment Management Co, a subsidiary of New China Trust, to identify investments in China.
"The current market environment presents us with unprecedented opportunities to invest in China at very attractive valuations," Musab Jassim, executive chairman, Amara Holdings said in a statement.
"Over the next 12 months Amara is planning to co-invest in projects each worth up to $200 million," a company spokeswoman said. "It is looking at consumer staples, utilities and agriculture in both listed and non-listed firms."
Set up in 1979, New China Trust and Investment Co, in which Barclays (
) holds a 19.5 percent stake, manages assets of about $4 billion.
Amara, which plans to list on London's Alternative Investment Market, was launched in October by prominent businessmen from the Gulf Arab region to invest in sectors more resilient to the downturn.
Last month, OPEC oil exporter Kuwait said it was looking to raise its stake in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (
