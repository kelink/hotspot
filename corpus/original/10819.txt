(Reuters) - Mexico's peso slipped to a six-week low on Monday as a sell-off in Chinese stocks unnerved global investors and concerns mounted that Mexico will fail to pass tax reforms needed to stave off a ratings downgrade.

The government's benchmark 10-year peso bond MX10YT=RR bid up 6 basis points to yield 8.21 percent.
