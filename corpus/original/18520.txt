(Reuters) - Car sales in India rose for a third straight month in April, helped by lower borrowing costs, rural demand and the government's stimulus measures, but industry officials said a lasting recovery was still distant.
Data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) released on Monday showed automakers sold 102,899 cars in April, 4.2 percent higher than a year earlier. Car sales had slid for four months, before starting to rise in February.
Emerging markets like China, India, Russia and South America are seen as long-term growth markets for global automakers, but job losses and wage cuts in the wake of the financial crisis along with tight financing conditions have dampened vehicle sales in India since mid-2008.
India cut factory gate taxes and the central bank slashed its key lending rate by 4.25 percentage points since last October to 4.75 percent to revive demand, but an industry official said more government measures were needed to sustain the sales momentum.
"We have to be careful before saying there are signs of revival. The fundamentals are still weak," said Sugato Sen, a senior director at SIAM.
"In the next few months, unless further positive policy intervention is there, things will not improve."
