(Reuters) - East Star Airlines, a debt-laden privately-owned Chinese airline, officially went bankrupt on Thursday after a long and desperate fight to stay aloft. It was the first of China's airlines to do so.
The Intermediate People's Court in East Star's hometown of Wuhan said a plan submitted by the East Star Group and ChinaEquity was unfeasible and failed to meet the conditions for a legal restructuring, the Xinhua news agency said on Thursday.
East Star, founded in 2005 by a travel agency and a real estate company both owned by the East Star Group, at its peak accounted for 10 percent of market share in Wuhan, in central China. It was China's fourth private airline.
It foundered on rising debt, tough competition for passengers, and a drop in air travel as the economy stumbled last year. Its total debt surpassed 752 million yuan ($110.1 million) last month.
East Star was grounded by the industry regulator on March 15, after rejecting a takeover offer from Air China's (
It then launched a dramatic search for a rescuer, at one point in June calling a night-time press conference at which anonymous executives announced a $500 million yuan investment by a firm that did not appear to have a valid street address.
ChinaEquity, an investment firm, earlier this month promised to invest 200 million to 300 million yuan for East Star's restructuring, but it did not specify the source of the funding, failed to provide certificates and documents, and lacked measures to protect creditors, the court found.
East Star Airlines had no operating income in 2008. ChinaEquity recorded 470,000 yuan in main business income and a 187,477 yuan deficit last year, the court found.
