2009-10-23 00:27:00.0
(Reuters) - Copper climbed to a 13-month high on Friday as upbeat data in the United States and Europe renewed prospects for economic recovery and metals demand.
Zinc touched $2,297.50, its highest point since May 2008, having gained nearly 17 percent this month, more than any other LME traded metal. Zinc premiums are set to rise as mills that use the metal to galvanise steel restart production due to rising demand, industry sources said. [ID:nLN320526]
Benchmark zinc MZN3 on the London Metal Exchange ended at $2,273 a tonne from $2,250 at the close on Thursday while copper MCU3 ended at $6,649 from $6,585.
The red metal earlier touched $6,714 -- a level last seen on Sept. 29, 2008 -- and is on course for its biggest weekly gain since July.
"There's been promising numbers from Europe and the U.S. today," said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, analyst at Danske Bank.
U.S. data out earlier showed existing home sales hit a two-year high in September. [ID:nN2390489] The U.S. housing market is key to driving demand for copper, a metal used primarily in power and construction.
In Europe, data showed industrial new orders in the Eurozone rose more than expected on the month in August, underlining expectations for an economic recovery. [ID:nLN271815]
The data added to numbers from China on Thursday which showed economic growth quickened to 8.9 percent in the third quarter. China is the world's leading copper consumer. [ID:nSP452724]

But capping gains in metals, the dollar rose against a basket of currencies, making dollar-priced metals more expensive for non-U.S. investors. [USD/]
"While we continue to remain bearish on the dollar's longer- term prospects, we suspect that we are quite oversold in the short term. We therefore would be wary about chasing this current bounce in metals," MF Global said in a note.
Analysts also warned about rising LME copper stocks, which suggest demand outside China remains weak. Latest data showed inventories rose 3,000 tonnes to total 367,075, their highest level since mid-May and a rise of about 40 percent since July.
In other metals, aluminium, used in transport and packaging, ended at $1,972 from $1,966 a tonne after earlier touching a two-month high at $2,000.
"We believe that energy prices would have to move closer to $90, and remain there, before aluminium would be able to sustain a move above $2,000," said Standard Bank in a note.
Aluminium is the most energy intensive of all the metals, and analysts believe if energy prices rise, even an over-supplied market like aluminium can clock up gains.
Stocks of aluminium fell 5,275 tonnes, according to latest LME data, but remained near record highs above 4.5 million tonnes.
Steel-making ingredient nickel MNI3 ended at $18,950 from $19,200, while battery material lead MPB3 ended at $2,360 from $2,405.
Tin MSN3 ended at $15,145 from $15,000, having earlier hit $15,600, its highest since mid-June.
