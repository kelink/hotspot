(Reuters) - China's push to consolidate oil refining could shut small independent plants with enough capacity to refine 17.5 percent of all the crude oil China processed last year, according to a Xinhua newsletter published on Friday.
China vowed last week to close down some of its outmoded oil refining capacity, targeting small independent plants capable of processing less than 20,000 barrels per day, nicknamed "teapots".
The National Development and Reform Commission said it would get rid of oil processing plants that are smaller than 1 million tonnes a year (20,000 bpd) by 2011 and take measures to encourage the closure, merger or transformation of refining units with annual capacities of 2-3 million tonnes (20,000-40,000 bpd).
"It's estimated that roughly 50 million-60 million tons of refining facilities have their single capacity less than one million tons nationwide," the Xinhua-run newsletter OGP said, citing no source.
It also said that Chinese teapots have about 80 million tonnes of crude processing capacities, more than half of that in the eastern Shandong province.
Teapots supply more than 20 percent of oil to China, the world's second largest oil-consuming country, which refined 342 million tonnes of crude in 2008.
To fill the slack left by the closing teapots, which often act as a swing supplier, Chinese oil majors are ramping up efforts to expand their own refining capacity.
Asian's top refiner, Sinopec Corp (
), has said it plans to add 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year, or nearly 10 percent. [ID:nPEK319906]
China's overall crude inventories, including state emergency reserves, also expanded by one million tonnes in March to the highest level since January 2008.
