(Reuters) - The head of Bank of America's (
) Asia mergers and acquisitions practice is leaving the bank, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday, the latest in a series of high-level departures for the firm.
Kalpana Desai is head of Asia M&A, excluding Japan and including India and Australia. She spent more than a decade in Hong Kong with Merrill Lynch before the BofA takeover.
Desai will stay on at BofA for the next few weeks to help the transition, the source said. The source did not want to be named because the departure had not yet been officially announced.
Desai became an M&A group head in 2002. In 2008, she was named M&A head for all of Asia, ex-Japan.
Merrill was not an early comer to Asia, but about five years ago it quickly built up its banking business to handle the region's booming economic growth.
Merrill went from 12th place in 2007 on the M&A Asia (ex Japan) league tables to 5th place in 2008, on 39 completed deals worth $36.2 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.
During her career, Desai was involved in PCCW's $28.5 billion deal in 2000 to buy Cable & Wireless HKT, and IBM's sale of its PC-making business to China's Lenovo Group for $1.25 billion in 2004. (Editing by Ken Wills)
