(Reuters) - Chinese software company CDC Corp CHINA.O posted a wider fourth-quarter loss from continuing operations, hurt by impairment charges and a drop in software revenue, sending its shares down 11 percent after the bell.
The company, which develops enterprise software, online games and Internet portals, posted a net loss of $84 million, compared with a net loss of $94 million a year ago.
Loss from continuing operations was $84.3 million, wider than the $26.2 million it reported a year earlier.
The company said it does not expect double-digit growth at CDC Games, which offers online games in China, to continue into the first quarter, due to several factors including seasonality.
