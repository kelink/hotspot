(Reuters) - Japan's public pension fund, the largest in the world, is considering investing in emerging market equities from the financial year starting next April, the Nikkei said on Friday.
The Government Pension Investment Fund, which managed about 117.6 trillion yen ($1.2 trillion) in assets as of the end of March, may target higher returns by investing in stocks in countries such as China and India, the business daily reported without citing any sources.
The GPIF has been reviewing a new model portfolio that it plans to implement from next financial year and has been considering a wide range of investment ideas, he said.
GPIF President Takahiro Kawase told Reuters in an interview in February that the fund may eventually invest in alternative assets, such as hedge funds, but needed to study the asset class in depth first. [ID:nLC817273]
The GPIF posted a record loss of almost $100 billion in the year that ended in March, hit hard by the global financial crisis and a sharp appreciation in the yen. [ID:nT144477]
Of the money it manages, 73.94 percent is in domestic bonds, including zaito bonds used to fund projects for government-related entities, 9.69 percent is in Japanese stocks, 7.72 percent is in foreign stocks, 8.51 percent is in foreign bonds and 0.14 percent is in short term assets.
It allocates its investments based on its model portfolio, which currently is weighted 67 percent to domestic bonds, 11 percent to domestic stocks, 9 percent to foreign stocks and 8 percent to foreign bonds. (Reporting by Chikafumi Hodo; Editing by Hugh Lawson)
