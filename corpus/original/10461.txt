"Despite the fact that we have the first central bank to come out with a rate hike it's still very much a risk happy environment," said Tom Levinson, a currency strategist at ING in London.

While the Fed and the European Central Bank may be in no hurry to raise rates, "other central banks appear more willing to reverse some of the massive monetary accommodation that has been put in place over the past year," said Stuart Bennett, currency strategist at Calyon.
Earlier, the U.S. dollar fell after Britain's Independent newspaper reported Gulf Arab states were in secret talks with Russia, China, Japan and France to replace the dollar with a basket of currencies in oil trading over nine years. [ID:nSYD421795]
But Saudi Arabia's central bank chief said the story was "absolutely incorrect" [ID:nFCC000043] while authorities from Kuwait and United Arab Emirates said they did not see any need for a new currency for oil trade.
Russia had not discussed changing the dollar's role in the global trade of oil, deputy Russian finance minister Dmitry Pankin said. [ID:nFCC000045] Japanese finance minister Hirohisa Fujii also said he was unaware of the report.
