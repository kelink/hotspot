(Reuters) - An Indian air force transport plane crashed near the disputed Chinese border in the remote northeast, killing all 14 on board, officials said on Wednesday.
"The aircraft has crashed," Amzad Tak, a senior state official told Reuters. "The army has found all the 14 bodies."
The plane was on a routine sortie to supply food, medicines and other essential items to troops guarding the frontier in remote, inaccessible areas.
India and China fought a brief war over their 3,500 km (2,200 mile) Himalayan border in 1962, and both claim the other is occupying big but largely uninhabited chunks of their territory.
Although India and China signed a treaty to maintain "peace and tranquility" along the disputed frontier and agreed to find a political solution to the row, talks have made little progress.
The governor of Arunachal Pradesh said on Monday India will deploy 50,000-60,000 extra troops on the state's border with China.
