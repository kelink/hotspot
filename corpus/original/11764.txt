(Reuters) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Tuesday it hired banking veteran Brad Cameron to head its Canadian mergers and acquisitions team, the latest sign a capital markets pick-up may be in the making in Canada.
Cameron is to assume the post in Toronto in the fall, likely in September, and is the third high-level addition to the U.S. bank's team north of the border since July .

Much of the so-called M&A action is seen happening in the oil and gas space, which featured major deals in recent years, including several that Cameron was involved in.

China's biggest overseas acquisition, the Addax deal was seen as the tip of the iceberg as Beijing snaps up reserves to secure energy supplies to fuel its growing economy.
