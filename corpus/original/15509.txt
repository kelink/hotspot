(Reuters) - Sri Lanka's stock market .CSE, fell for a second straight session on Tuesday, losing 0.31 percent after retail investors cashed in blue chips to lock in profits from an extended post-war rally.
The bourse fell 1.56 percent or 38.14 points to hit 2409.06 in the first two hours of trading on Tuesday, but recovered later and closed 7.49 points down to 2439.71.
"Retail profit-taking brought down the market," said Shivantha Meepage, a research analyst at Acuity Stockbrokers.
The rally has made the market one of the best-performing in Asia and it is among the strongest emerging markets this year, with an overall gain of 62.3 percent.
It touched a one-year high on Monday before falling at the close, and so far in June has the best performance of an Asian country followed by China and Japan as of Tuesday, Reuters data showed.
Shares in top conglomerate John Keells Holdings JKH.CM fell 1.75 percent to 135.25 rupees, while Commercial Bank of Ceylon COMB.CM fell 1.43 percent to 138 rupees.
Turnover hit 733.9 million rupees ($6.4 million), about 60 percent more than last year's daily average of 464 million.
The 2009 daily average turnover, which was 260.7 million until May 15, has since jumped over 60 percent to 419.35 million.
Strikingly, the anticipated foreign inflows have not come. Before the end of the war, net foreign inflows had been 1.4 billion rupees. But it has now turned to a net outflow of 391.41 million so far for the year, a bourse official said.
It lost 59.2 percent in 2008, making it one of the world's worst performing markets as it suffered war, inflation and the effects of the global market crash.
Analysts say a highly anticipated $1.9 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), increases in foreign inflows through aid to refugees and remittances, a decline in interest rates, and an expected boom in tourism have boosted the market.
Analysts said continued delay in the IMF loan could dampen positive market sentiments, though Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal has said there was no urgency for it now.
"Whenever there is final agreement then a program would go to the Executive Board, but we don't have that announcement to make now," Caroline Atkinson, director of external relations department at IMF told reporters in Washington last week.
Some investors have been cautious because of uncertainty over what effect the loan's conditions could have on the exchange rate.
The rupee closed flat at 114.90/95 a dollar as the central bank bought dollars at 114.90 rupees, dealers said.
The rupee hit a record low of 120.80/121.10 on April 23, after the central bank stopped preventing depreciation.
The interbank lending rate or call money rate CLIBOR edged down to 9.606 percent from Monday's 9.693 percent.
