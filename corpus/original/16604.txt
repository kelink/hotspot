(Reuters) - Australia's OZ Minerals Ltd (
), leaving the way open for a previous offer by China's Minmetals, a report said on Monday.
The fully underwritten $1.2 billion proposal, submitted late last week, involved $1 billion in equity and convertible bonds plus $200 million in working capital, and rivalled a $1.2 billion offer for most of the troubled miner's assets from Minmetals.
"We can confirm that OZ Minerals has come back and said they don't wish to pursue the proposal," a spokesman for the group told the newspaper.
The original deal with Minmetals, which is controlled by the Chinese government, is to be put to a shareholder vote on Thursday as originally planned, the report said.
No market statement would be made until Tuesday, the paper said, as the exchange is closed on Monday, a public holiday in most of Australia.
