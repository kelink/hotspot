(Reuters) - Japan's new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, said on Saturday he had asked his Chinese counterpart to make an international commitment on climate change and had been told China would do its best to help forge a global deal.
Hatoyama, who took office on September 15, has pledged Tokyo will cut emissions 25 percent by 2020 and hopes emerging nations like China will also sign up to an ambitious global deal.
China is now the world's top annual emitter of greenhouse gasses although on a per person basis it is still far behind industrialized nations. President Hu Jintao recently announced plans for a carbon intensity goal, which would lead to greener growth but not guarantee an overall fall in emissions.
"I know that China has some sort of domestic framework but it is important for China to make an international commitment for the success of (Copenhagen)," Hatoyama told reporters, after a meeting with premier Wen Jiabao on the sidelines of a summit with leaders from China, Japan and South Korea.
Wen said China will do its best to ensure the Copenhagen meeting is a success, Hatoyama said.
"He was interested in this issue and told me that China would like to do its best for (Copenhagen) to be successful," he said.
"I told him that we should make the East China Sea a sea of friendship by cooperating on exploring (for) its oil and natural gas. I also told him that we should work together on this issue based on a previous agreement," Hatoyama said.
The two leaders touched on food safety issues as well, a perennial concern for Japanese consumers, Hatoyama said, and he proposed a Japan-China initiative to discuss the issue.
