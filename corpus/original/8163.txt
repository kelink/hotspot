MONTEK SINGH AHLUWALIA - DEPUTY CHAIRMAN OF INDIA'S PLANNING COMMISSION
"But at the point when growth is distinctly below potential, the balance of the concern is essentially maintaining the growth rate."
"(Right) now, I don't think we are in a position where the inflation issue is anything other than something we keep a close watch on."
CARLOS GHOSN, CEO, RENAULT (
"I don't believe in a double-dip (recession)."
"For another dip, we have to move up. So far we haven't seen the move up. So double-dip for me is an interesting discussion, but that's not real."
"So when do we move up?" "It's very likely that we will start to move up in 2010 selectively with obviously China, India, Middle East, South America playing an important role. United States also."
"I am afraid Europe, Japan are still going to have a tough year in 2010."
INDRA NOOYI, CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE, PEPESICO (
"The world was a wonderful place when the United States was the engine of growth and all of us should root for the United States to become an engine of growth again, because it was the world's largest consuming country."
"Let's hope the downturn in the United States is shortlived."
"The United States is one of the most resilient countries and the United States will figure out a way out of this downturn, so I think the world will recover."
SUNIL MITTAL, CHAIRMAN, BHARTI AIRTEL (
"This is a business that needs huge investments, one has to commit billions of dollars."
"At the end of the day every economic model will require returns and if there are no returns, you will see consolidation ... World over consolidation has taken place. Wherever there have been more operators, they have been reduced. There is empirical evidence." (Compiled by Devidutta Tripathy and C.J. Kuncheria; Editing by Alistair Scrutton, Greg Mahlich)
