April 14 - First-quarter EBITA swings to a 74 million euro ($97.7 million) loss, from a 265 million euro profit a year before. Again says it plans to speed up restructuring.
July 13 - Philips surprises with Q2 EBITA of 118 million euros ($164.4 million), helped by cost cuts. Sets cost savings target at 600 mln euros for 2010.
Sept. 22 - Company aims to generate half its sales from emerging markets including India and China, up from one third, an official at its Indian unit says.
