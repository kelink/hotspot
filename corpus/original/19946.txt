(Reuters) - Air China (
), the country's flag carrier, on Tuesday said it will continue to increase capacity 2009 and has seen signs of improvement in its passenger and cargo businesses.
The airline would expand its fleet in a constrained manner by taking delivery of 27 aircraft this year and returning eight to 10 leased aircraft, Chairman Kong Dong told reporters.
Analysts said Air China and its two rivals, China Eastern Airlines (
), may return to profit this year as domestic air travel rebounded in the first quarter and said the trend could extend through the year.

Air China reversed losses by reporting a net profit of 981 million yuan ($143.6 million) in the first quarter of 2009, including an exceptional gain and helped by lower fuel costs.
"Demand improved in the first quarter and we have seen positive signs on both the cargo and passenger fronts, especially in the domestic market," said Chief Financial Officer Fan Cheng.
However, the airline plans to cut capital spending by up to 30 percent to between 9 billion and 10 billion yuan this year from 12.9 billion yuan in 2008.
), which is 17.5 percent owned by Air China, has delayed plane deliveries this year and has asked staff to take unpaid leave after it reported a 22.4 percent drop in revenue from passenger and cargo services in the first quarter. Air China's first-quarter results included a loss from its associate, Cathay Pacific, Fan said.
Shares of Air China have jumped 46 percent this year, outperforming a 14.5 percent rise on the index for major Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong
