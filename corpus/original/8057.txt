(Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday rejected criticism that he was giving short shrift to human rights issues in his approach toward China.
"I don't find the critics credible," Obama told Reuters in an interview. "If you look at my statements, they have been entirely consistent. We believe in the values of freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom of religion, that are not just core American values but we believe are universal values."
Critics have cited his decision last month not to meet with the Dalai Lama as a sign he was willing to play down human rights concerns to try to curry favor with the Chinese on other issues, such as the global economy and the Iranian and North Korean nuclear disputes.
"There has not been a meeting with the Chinese delegation in which we didn't bring these issues up. That will continue," Obama said. (Reporting by Caren Bohan; Editing by Anthony Boadle and Peter Cooney)
