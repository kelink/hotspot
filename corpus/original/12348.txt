(Reuters) - European shares were lower in early trade on Monday, following a four-week rally with banking shares and commodity stocks the biggest fallers on the main index.
By 0716 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300
index of top shares was down 0.4 percent at 946.63 points. Europe's benchmark index has risen around 16 percent since July 10, and is now up 13.6 percent in 2009. It has surged 46 percent since reaching a floor in early March.
