(Reuters) - Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA), the country's sovereign wealth fund agreed to more than double its investment in Agricultural Bank of China's ABC.UL initial public offering to $1.9 billion, a local newspaper said.
Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) also raised its stake to $6 billion from $2.8 billion, the paper said on Monday without citing sources, signaling Middle East funds took a big slice of the record IPO.
Earlier this month, AgBank said it had fully exercised an over-allotment option for the Shanghai portion of its initial public offering, taking total proceeds from the offer to $22.1 billion, making the IPO the world's biggest.
Eleven cornerstone investors were selected for the bank's Hong Kong share offering, including QIA and KIA, taking a combined $5.45 billion worth of shares.
