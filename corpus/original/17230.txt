(Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei average rose 0.1 percent on Monday to touch a more than 7-month high, buoyed by hopes for China's recovery that lifted resource shares, shippers and trading houses.

"People will be keeping their eyes on GM today, making it difficult for the market to rise that much," said Masayoshi Yano, a senior market analyst at Meiwa Sedurities.
"Even though people say it's been factored in, they still want to wait and see."
But positive sentiment was spreading in the market after U.S. consumer confidence rose in May to its highest in eight months and after the Nikkei posted a third successive month of gains in May, the first such streak since April-June 2007.
"We're seeing a lot of shares up today on expectations for China's recovery as well, and while this is still of course just expectations it's buoying all the so-called China plays: metals, shippers, trading houses, and individual shares such as Komatsu," said Nagayuki Yamagishi, a strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities.
"The situation with GM also seems to be pretty well cleaned up, and this will remove a major source of uncertainty."
Others disagreed, though, noting that the benchmark Nikkei's sustained move above its 200-day moving average -- which now comes in a bit above 9,300 -- should have set the stage for sharp gains, but that inevitable worry about GM was keeping gains capped.
