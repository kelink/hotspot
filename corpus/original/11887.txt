(Reuters) - Shipper Golden Ocean (
) posted a steep fall in second-quarter operating profit, in line with forecasts, and predicted a steady third quarter with Chinese imports driving demand for dry bulk shipping.
Operating profit fell to $28 million in April-June from $64 million a year ago, roughly in line with an average forecast of $25 million from a Reuters poll of 11 analysts.
The Oslo bourse-listed shipper said its net profit amounted to $101 million, against forecasts at $106 million, boosted by gains from bond buy-backs during the quarter.
"China has more or less been the sole contributor to the positive development experienced in the demand for dry bulk transportation," Golden Ocean said in a statement.
It added that the prices of steel, alumina and iron ore "started to rebound in May and the positive development has continued into the third quarter", helping a rebound on shipping markets that were pummelled by the global economic crisis.
"After the improved operating results in the second quarter, the board anticipates that operating results will remain more or less at (the) same level for the third quarter," Golden Ocean said.
The global crisis had ravaged freight rates since mid-2008 and forced Golden Ocean to raise $110 million in new equity in April, and cancel or delay ship construction contracts. (Reporting by Oslo newsroom; editing by Simon Jessop)
