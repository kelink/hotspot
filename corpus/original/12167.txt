The tie-up will create a localised version of the software to introduce to provide music over computers and mobile phones, Tom said in a statement to Reuters. Spotify's current services are only available over computers.
"Tom will work towards unveiling a localised version of Spotify in Greater China in the near future," the statement said.
The foundation, venture capital firm Wellington Partners and others are close to investing up to $50 million, which would value Spotify at $250 million, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the process.
Tom is majority owned by Li, and also counts eBay Inc (
