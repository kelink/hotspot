But the pipeline would have to pass through communist North Korea, which technically remains at war with its wealthy southern neighbour and further raised tensions in the region on Saturday by announcing resumption of plutonium extraction from spent fuel rods at its nuclear plants. [ID:nSEO368354]
"If the project succeeds, a great amount will be paid to North Korea and it will offer them a big help," Lee told the visiting Russian foreign minister, who travelled to Seoul from Pyongyang this week after pressing North Korea to return to the sputtering international talks to stop its nuclear programme.
"Such efforts will improve relations with the North and also help North Korea becoming a member of international community... I believe the North will be also interested," Lee said, asking Russia to help bring the North back into the talks involving Russia, the two Koreas, China, Japan and the United States.
The move follows a tightening of international trade sanctions against North Korea as a result of its defiant rocket launch earlier this month, widely seen as a disguised long-range missile test that violated U.N. resolutions.
A U.N. Security Council committee on Friday placed three North Korean firms on a U.N. blacklist for aiding Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programme, eliciting a sharp rebuke from a North Korean envoy. [ID:nN2445869] (Reporting by Miyoung Kim; Editing by Alex Richardson)
