Mexico official says yuan flexibility positive

(Reuters) - A senior Mexican official said China's decision to allow the yuan currency to strengthen is positive for the global economy and could reduce the risk for future financial crises.
China loosened the yuan's 23-month-old peg to the U.S. dollar on Monday, easing a policy aimed at steadying its economy during the global downturn and paving the way for the currency to appreciate as demanded by the United States and other major trade partners.
"In principal, more flexibility in the yuan, which helps reduce global imbalances, is good news," Miguel Messmacher, the finance ministry's chief economist, told Reuters on Monday.
Messmacher, who is helping craft Mexico's position on macroeconomic issues for the Group of 20 summit later this week, said more details were needed from China on how it would allow the currency to trade. Mexico has been one of the countries pushing for a revalued yuan.
"It will be an important and positive factor that helps reduce the global imbalances that were one of the risk factors associated with the international financial crisis (that erupted in 2008)," Messmacher said.
"But we still really don't know the details (of China's currency plan)."
