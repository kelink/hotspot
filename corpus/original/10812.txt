(Reuters) - Chile's leading market index tumbled to six-week lows on Monday on sliding commodities stocks after a sell-off in Chinese stocks stirred concerns among emerging market investors, while the peso closed weaker, traders said.
Chile's blue-chip IPSA stock market index .IPSA closed down 1.45 percent to 3,175.18 points while the all-market IGPA .IGPA fell 1.41 percent to 15,072.59 after steep losses on the Shanghai bourse raised questions about China's ability to lead a recovery in global economic growth.
"The Chinese market had a steep fall today, and global bourses followed, including Chile," said Rodrigo Andaur, head of research with FIT Research. "And that caused commodities stocks, among others, to slide."
