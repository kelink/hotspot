(Reuters) - China will stick to its plan to reduce the number of Beijing-controlled state firms to 80-100 by 2010 from 138 now, a senior official said on Monday.
Li Rongrong, head of China's State-owned Asset Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), said he would allow private and foreign investors to participate in the looming consolidation.
"Our goal has not changed, and although we have only one and a half years left, we will still do it," Li said in an online interview, the transcript of which was published by the official Xinhua news agency and on SASAC's website (www.sasac.gov.cn).
China established SASAC in 2003 to oversee the biggest non-bank state-owned enterprises (SOEs), usually parent companies of the largest listed firms such as PetroChina (
), Sinopec (
), Chalco (
In the last six years, the number of SOEs under the direct supervision of SASAC has shrunk to 138 from 196. They had total assets of 18 trillion yuan ($2.6 trillion) at end of 2008.
Some economists doubt the effectiveness of government-led tie-ups, but Li said SASAC would keep driving the streamlining process and would try to make sure that every merger was commercially sound.
"We want to reallocate existing resources and improve efficiency so that one-plus-one can add up to more than two," Li said.
Mergers of big SOEs have the potential to alter China's industrial landscape, with potential global repercussions.
One possible deal in the works, according to Chinese media reports, would involve Minmetals, a major buyer of mineral assets around the world, taking over Luzhong Metallurgy and Mining Group, a big local iron ore producer, and Changsha Research Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, an entity with 2.0 billion yuan in assets.
