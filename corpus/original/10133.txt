(Reuters) - Iran's state oil firm, France's Total (
) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) will soon meet to discuss development of a gas field in the Gulf, a senior Iranian official was quoted as saying on Sunday.
Reza Kasaiezadeh, managing director of Iran's National Gas Export Company, said the meeting would be held to decide on upstream and midstream development of phase 11 of the South Pars field, ISNA news agency reported. He did not elaborate.
It came a day after another news agency, Mehr, said Iran's National Iranian Oil Company and Total had resumed talks about the French energy firm's participation in a major liquefied natural gas (LNG) project after a gap of several months.
In June, the official Iranian news agency, IRNA, said Tehran had signed a $4.7 billion contract with CNPC to develop phase 11 of the South Pars gas field, replacing Total, which it had accused of delays. Iranian officials have suggested that Total could still play a role in the project.
Iran has the world's second largest gas reserves, almost 16 percent of the world's total, but currently has no major net exports partly because U.S. and U.N. sanctions have deterred investment by Western firms with expertise and technology.
The South Pars reservoir is shared by Iran and Qatar. The Iranian part is divided into 24 phases. (Reporting by Hashem Kalantari; writing by Fredrik Dahl; editing by Simon Jessop)
