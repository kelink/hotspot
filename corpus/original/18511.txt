Safina rallied from a set and 2-0 down to earn the right to face her compatriot Svetlana Kuznetsova, who barged past Belarusian Victoria Azarenka with a 6-2 6-4 win.
"She (Kuznetsova) is another great player and she's playing some of her best tennis," Safina told a news conference.
"So I'll have to go out there and play my best like did I today."
American fourth seed Williams played the tidier, more intelligent tennis early on to go 4-1 and then 5-2 ahead.
Safina, who also fought back to get past China's Zheng Jie and Spain's Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez this week, refused to cave in and began to mixed up her game more.
"She was a little bit passive (at the end of the match)," added Safina. "I think she showed me she was maybe nervous too and I went for the shots and I did the right thing. She pushed me to play my best."
Despite the defeat, the WTA said Williams would jump from fifth to third in the world rankings next week, her highest position since 2003.
"She played well, continued to fight for every point," Williams said.
"She went for every shot. She just hit every ball as hard as she could. Obviously she didn't want me to have the first shot or to take control. If she can hit every ball that hard and keep it in, then congratulations to her."
Kuznetsova initially found it easy to attack 19-year-old Azarenka's serve and won the first set at a canter.
Azarenka began the second set by winning the first two games and was unlucky in the third, when Kuznetsova held a tough service game with the help of a bad call on the final point.
The Belarusian threatened to come back, pulling up to 5-4 before the former U.S. Open champion broke again to clinch the match.
