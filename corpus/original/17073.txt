(Reuters) - Mexico's Cemex (

), saddled with heavy debts, issued the $3 billion in perpetual notes to private investors in 2007.
"We have been closing derivative positions since September of last year to simplify our capital structure and reduce volatility in our financial statements," the spokesman said in a statement.
The holders of the perpetual securities would not be affected by the transaction and would be paid the same amount of interest originally scheduled to be paid on June 30, he said.
Monterrey-based Cemex, which bought Australia's Rinker in 2007 just as the U.S. housing crisis surfaced, has been hit by slumping sales and is struggling to refinance $14.5 billion in bank debt due over the next three years.
The company, which operates in more than 50 countries, was battered by losses on derivatives amid the global financial meltdown late last year.
Shares in the cement maker surged 11.87 percent to 14.23 pesos on Monday while its New York-traded shares were up 10.96 percent at $10.83 as reassuring economic data in the United States and China reinforced hopes of economic stabilization.
