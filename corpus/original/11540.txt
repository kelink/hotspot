(Reuters) - Western powers will have to respond with further sanctions against Iran if there is no progress on nuclear talks, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a newspaper in remarks released on Thursday.
"If there is no progress, we have to react with further sanctions. It is clear that there cannot be an atomic bomb in the hands of Tehran which has a president who constantly questions the existence of Israel," she was quoted as saying.
U.S. President Barack Obama has given Iran until September to take up a six-power offer of talks on trade benefits if it shelves sensitive nuclear enrichment, or face harsher sanctions.
Iran, the world's fifth-largest crude exporter, imports up to 40 percent of its gasoline.
Asked what sort of sanctions the powers would consider, Merkel said:
She added that Germany and its partners would have to decide in September on any further action, adding there was no noticeable progress on nuclear talks with Iran.
