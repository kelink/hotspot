New China stimulus tranche less than expected

(Reuters) - China's central government will spend 70 billion yuan ($10.3 billion) in the third tranche of its stimulus package, falling short of market expectations, a Chinese newspaper has reported.
Investment in sectors that have stronger prospects will be scaled back, an unnamed official at the National Development and Reform Commission, the country's top planning agency, was quoted as saying by the Chinese-language Economic Observer.
The smaller investment reflected adjustments to the stimulus program and did not mean that the central government's finances were under pressure, the Economic Observer cited the planning official as saying.
Commercial banks have also more than answered the government's call to boost lending, making an astonishing 4.58 trillion yuan in new loans in the first quarter, close to the government's minimum target of 5 trillion yuan for the full year.
The smaller stimulus tranche could also be because officials are still in the planning stage of many investment projects and are not ready to break ground on them, the Economic Observer added.
The central government has promised to contribute 1.18 trillion yuan to the 4 trillion yuan, two-year stimulus package to combat the economic slowdown, with the remainder coming from local governments, banks and companies.
China's economy grew at an annual pace of 6.1 percent in the first three months of this year, its weakest quarter on record, but analysts said that it actually rebounded strongly on a quarter-on-quarter basis.
