Chinalco likely to back Rio rights issue: source

(Reuters) - China's state-owned Chinalco is likely to participate in global miner Rio Tinto Ltd's (
) $15.2 billion rights offer, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters on Wednesday, in a sign that China was keen to retain its interest in the world's top iron ore miner.
Rio's rights issue, the fifth-biggest on record, closes on Wednesday and is seen generating strong demand on signs of a recovery in the global economy.
Chinalco's ALUMI.UL relations with Rio soured early last month after the indebted miner called off a bigger equity partnership that would have seen the Chinese group invest another $19.5 billion into dual-listed Rio Tinto (
Instead, Rio ditched the deal in favor of the rights issue and an iron ore joint venture with rival BHP Billiton (
), raising howls of protest from China where state media characterized Rio as a "dishonorable woman."
The 21-for-40 rights issue is being priced at A$28.29 per Australian-listed share and 1,400 pence per London-listed share.
Chinalco, Rio's top shareholder, owns about 9 percent of the combined group and a full take-up of the rights would lead to an outlay of about 880 million pounds ($1.5 billion)
If Chinalco takes up its entitlement in full, that would bring down its average holding cost in Rio. Chinalco had bought its initial stake at 60 pounds ($99.69) per share in February 2008 in a raid on the London-listed stock.
By Wednesday afternoon, Rio's Australian listed shares were trading down 2.6 percent at A$50.86, outpacing a 2 percent fall in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index .AXJO.
Rio is raising money to reduce its $38 billion mountain of debt, which it accumulated when it bought Canadian aluminum group Alcan at the top of the commodities market in 2007.
