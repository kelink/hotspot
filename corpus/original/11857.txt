(Reuters) - CITIC Pacific (
), reeling from nearly $2 billion in foreign exchange-related losses suffered last year, said it was selling the bulk of its holdings in Hong Kong's flagship Cathay Pacific Airways (
) for HK$6.3 billion ($808 million), the companies said in a joint statement to the Hong Kong exchange.
Separately, Cathay's parent Swire Pacific (
) will also buy a 2 percent stake in the Hong Kong carrier for HK$1.01 billion, bringing its total holdings in Cathay to 41.97 percent, according to the statement.
In October of last year, CITIC Pacific revealed that it had endured steep losses from bets on derivative contracts known as "accumulators". At the time, the company admitted that mark-to-market losses incurred from the unauthorised foreign exchange contracts could reach $1.9 billion. [ID:nHKG313184]
In a press conference following Monday's announcement, Christopher Pratt, chairman of Swire and Cathay, confirmed that CITIC Pacific had initiated the discussions that led to the sale of the Cathay shares.
Both Swire and Air China will pay HK$12.88 per share, which represents a 10.8 percent premium to Friday's closing price.
"Most people don't believe CITIC had added value to Cathay. Air China could probably create better synergy with Cathay Pacific in terms of expanding and strengthening their routes," said Jim Wong, head of transport research with Nomura Securities.
In their remarks to reporters, Swire executives also stressed the benefits of increased collaboration.
Today, the two airlines' collaboration extends to code-sharing, frequent flyer programs and joint staff training. The airlines are also negotiating a cargo joint venture.
"We welcome this as a strengthening of our strategic partnership with Air China," said Pratt.
Cathay shares last traded down 1.9 percent at HK$11.62 on Aug 14, but the stock was up over 33 percent so far this year.
Swire, whose shares were not suspended, on Monday closed 2.4 percent lower at HK$81.95, outperforming a 3.6 percent fall by the broader Hong Kong market
