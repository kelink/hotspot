Hong Kong democrats to resign, forcing referendum

(Reuters) - Five Hong Kong lawmakers will resign from the legislature in late January in a bid to pressure China to grant the former British colony greater and swifter democratic concessions, a spokesman announced on Monday.
A spokesman for the legislators, Kenneth Chan, described their move as a "de facto referendum" on democracy.
The resignation of the lawmakers and subsequent by-elections were "a very important opportunity for Hong Kong citizens as a whole to express their strong desire for democracy for Hong Kong as soon as possible," Chan told reporters.
Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997, has grappled with Beijing's Communist Party for more than a decade over a roadmap toward universal suffrage, as guaranteed in the city's mini-constitution.
The city's various opposition groups, known collectively as the "pan-democratic camp" and which controls 23 legislature seats, risks losing its crucial one-third veto bloc if the plan backfires and they fail to be re-elected.
"We have nothing to lose. No pain, no gain," said To Kwan Hang, another spokesman for the resigning legislators.
The organizers called on Hong Kong people to unite and vote for the democratic lawmakers, who say they will declare the by-elections invalid if less than 50 percent of eligible voters cast ballots.
