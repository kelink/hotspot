(Reuters) - China reported its second suspected case of the new H1N1 strain of flu, a man in eastern Shandong province who had recently arrived from Canada, state media said on Tuesday.
Tests on the patient showed that he was "suspected positive" of being infected with the A/H1N1 virus, Xinhua news agency cited the Health Ministry as saying.
The Chinese man flew from Canada, where he was studying, on May 8 and then took a train from Beijing to Jinan, the capital of Shandong province. He was immediately isolated and sent for treatment after reporting flu-like symptoms on the train.
The patient with China's first confirmed case of H1N1, a 30-year-old man who flew to the country from United States via Japan, was recovering, Xinhua said on Tuesday.
It said a total of 125 people in Chengdu, the Sichuan provincial capital where the first confirmed case was reported, had been put under quarantine, but at least 50 others who had potentially come into contact with him were unaccounted for.
China has vowed to disclose any human cases of the new fever promptly, while state-run newspapers have urged officials to be open and avoid the kind of cover-ups that brought panic during the SARS epidemic in 2003.
While there have been improvements in recent years, their health infrastructure is still seen as rudimentary and would be hard pressed to cope with any huge rise in hospital admissions.
Seasonal flu kills 250,000 to 500,000 people globally and infects up to a third of the population every year. (Reporting by Simon Rabinovitch)
