) will finance the expansion of a coal power station in Botswana for $825 million over 20 years, Standard Bank said on Tuesday.
Standard Bank, which is 20 percent owned by ICBC, said the firms would also provide a $140 million bridge finance facility for Morupule B Power Station in eastern Botswana.
The deal is the first major transaction between Standard Bank and ICBC, and was backed by a guarantee from Botswana's ministry of finance.
"There is little doubt that had it not been for our strategic partnership with ICBC, we would not have been able to undertake the funding of a project of this scale," Standard Bank Chief Executive Jacko Maree said in a statement.
The $1.6 billion Morupule coal power station is part of Botswana's strategy to secure power supply by expanding the existing generating capacity as well as improving the southern African country's self-reliance.
ICBC's client China National Electric Equipment Corporation has been awarded a $970 million contract to supply and build part of the power station. (Reporting by Serena Chaudhry)
