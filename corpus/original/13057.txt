Actelion mulls asthma marketing partnership

(Reuters) - Europe's biggest biotech company Actelion (
) could consider a partnership deal to help market an asthma drug, its chief executive told Reuters on Wednesday.
Actelion would prefer any deal on the drug, a so-called CRTH2 receptor antagonist, to be with one of its current partners, GlaxoSmithKline (
), Roche (
), Jean-Paul Clozel said.
"A lot of companies have already approached us about this product, but we want to develop this project ourselves," Clozel said at Actelion's Basel headquarters, adding the firm would take the product into late stage trials before any deal.
"One aspect is either to continue with the same companies that we are partnered with already, not to add another collaboration, or to do it as late as possible," he said in the interview. "I think with three partners it already becomes difficult to get the fourth partner."
The group is trying to cut its dependence on Tracleer, which treats a heart and lung disease and rakes in more than $1 billion a year, by developing it in new indications and pushing other new drugs to market.
Clozel reckons approval of Tracleer to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a fatal lung disease, could double current sales, which reached 739 million Swiss francs ($686 million) in the first half of 2009.
Emerging markets like China, Russia, Eastern Europe and Latin America are a big opportunity, while Actelion also aims to push into antibiotics, given the spread of infectious diseases like H1N1 swine flu.
The group is sitting on a large cash pile of 1.2 billion francs and prefers to use that for acquiring or partnering other medicines, having no plans to return cash to shareholders through dividends or buybacks, Clozel said.
"We have better things to create value with this money than giving back," he added. "You need the money to fuel this growth."
