(Reuters) - The United Nations on Monday appointed France's U.N. Ambassador, Jean-Maurice Ripert, to the new post of special envoy for assistance to Pakistan, where he will coordinate aid efforts amid a refugee crisis.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon created the job to help Pakistan's government and the international community respond to a humanitarian crisis created by fighting between government forces and Taliban fighters, a U.N. announcement said.
More than 2 million people were forced to leave their homes following a government offensive in April against the Taliban in northwest Pakistan. Many refugees have now returned, but hundreds of thousands remain in camps or host communities.
Ripert, a 56-year-old career diplomat, will promote "a strategic, coherent and comprehensive approach to supporting the humanitarian, recovery and reconstruction needs of crisis-affected areas," the U.N. said in its statement.
France announced last month that his replacement will be Gerard Araud, political director at the French Foreign Ministry and a former French Ambassador to Israel. France has a permanent, veto-holding seat on the U.N. Security Council, as do the United States, Britain, Russia and China. (Reporting by Patrick Worsnip; Editing by Paul Simao)
