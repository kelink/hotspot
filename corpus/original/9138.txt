"This has been an extraordinary year, things fell off a cliff overnight."
"I don't think we are, still, in a very pretty place regionally or globally in a pretty place, but there is better visibility."
Corporate governance "is nowhere near where it needs to be, but it's moving in the right direction."
"If I'm a large company listed in Dubai and my stock is going to go up regardless, so I'm not gonna meet with analysts. I actually find it shameful that such a company would not meet with analysts -- then don't be a public company. You don't have a choice if you choose to open up your investor base to shareholders, you do not have the choice."
SHAFQAT MALIK, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, ALDAR PROPERTIES
"You have to plan, plan, plan for every eventuality."
"It's not all doom and gloom. There is business, there is a market."
HOWARD HANDY, CHIEF ECONOMIST, SAMBA
SIMON COOPER, DEPUTY CHAIRMAN AND CEO, HSBC BANK MIDDLE EAST LTD
On the biggest danger as the economy recovers: "Over-enthusiasm." "I wouldn't like to see floods of speculative investment"
JEAN-PAUL MOLLIE, MIDDLE EAST, SOUTH ASIA & AFRICA REGIONAL PRESIDENT AT DOW CORNING
