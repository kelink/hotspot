) SMCB.PS is interested in buying a 600-megawatt coal-fired power plant which French utility Suez LYOE.PA has decided not to acquire, a government official said on Thursday.
Suez unit Emerald Energy Corp made a winning bid of $786.5 million for the Calaca plant, south of Manila, in an auction in 2007. But the company then said in January it would not complete the deal after the condition of the plant deteriorated.
Seven other local and foreign groups have also expressed an interest in acquiring the Calaca plant which is being sold by the government's Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management (PSALM) agency.
San Miguel is "looking at Calaca," said Jose Ibazeta, president of PSALM, which is tasked with selling the assets and managing the debts of National Power Corp, the country's biggest electricity producer.
San Miguel, the biggest food and drinks company in Southeast Asia, has been diversifying into heavy industry, including oil and power, to feed future growth. It bought a 27 percent stake in power retailer Manila Electric Co (
) and acquire a 25-year licence to run the country's power grid.
He also said San Miguel, which earlier expressed an interest in the 620-MW Limay diesel power plant, is no longer interested in this facility which will be up for auction on June 19.
The government had failed to sell the Limay power plant northwest of the capital in two earlier auctions, the last in January.
Since 2005, the government has sold 12 power plants worth nearly $2.4 billion.
In January, the state handed a 25-year licence to a consortium led by China's State Grid Corp to run the country's power grid after the group made a winning bid of $3.95 billion in 2007 in what was the Southeast Asian nation's biggest privatisation deal.
