AmCham Shanghai's business climate report surveyed 346 American companies operating in China. Results from the survey show companies optimistic and performing well.
Below are some of the survey's results:
* A comparison of survey results across years shows U.S. companies found it more difficult to attract managers, executives, technical staff and other skilled workers in 2010 than in 2009.
* Nearly 80 percent of companies agree that China's regulatory environment is not transparent, though China has demonstrated an increased commitment to transparency and has made several pieces of draft legislation available for public comment.
* China's government procurement rules and "indigenous innovation" policies, which promote bringing to market home-grown technologies, may restrict opportunities for foreign companies from competing fairly in China's growing procurement market valued at $88 billion.
* According to this year's survey, 71 percent of respondents feel enforcement of intellectual property rights "stayed the same" or "deteriorated," up from 61 percent in 2009 and 64 percent in 2008. It remains a top concern because U.S. companies perceive a lack of protection and enforcement for intellectual property rights to be a blow to their competitive advantage and is costing U.S. companies billions of dollars.
The success indicator measures U.S. companies' business performance. Companies in China are considered successful to the extent survey responses meet requirements such as profitability, revenue growth exceeding 20 percent, and "very positive" cash flow.
