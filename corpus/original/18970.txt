(Reuters) - Global manufacturing activity contracted at its slowest pace in seven months in April helped by signs of improvement across the euro zone and the Unites States, a survey showed on Monday.
The global index, produced by JP Morgan with research and supply management organisations, rose to 41.8 in April from 37.3 in March, its highest in seven months, but still well below the 50.0 mark dividing growth from contraction.
The rise in the PMI was helped by the biggest month-on-month gains in the survey's 12-year history in the output, new orders, new export orders and employment indices.
Earlier data showed the euro zone PMI picked up to a six-month high, while the rate of decline output eased in the United States to its slowest level since last October. Both remained deep in recession territory.
The global data also showed the employment index rising to a five-month high, though firms were still cutting jobs at close to a record pace.
Meanwhile, the input price index rose to a five-month high, but still pointed to low inflationary pressures.
The index combines survey data from countries including the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia. (Editing by Mike Peacock)
