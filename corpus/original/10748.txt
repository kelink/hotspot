North Koreans sail to South in rare defection by sea

(Reuters) - Eleven North Koreans have defected to the South by sea, a military official said in Seoul, a rare escape directly across the border amid a tense security standoff between the rivals.
"Those people came by a boat off the east coast," an official at South Korea's Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said. "They are here. They are seeking asylum."
Defections by North Koreans are more common through China which borders the North. A group of nine entered the Danish embassy in Hanoi last week with a South Korean activist, seeking asylum.
More than 16,000 North Koreans have defected to the South since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, almost all in the past 10 years, according to South Korea's Unification Ministry.
Fishing boats have drifted across maritime borders between the two Koreas in recent years mostly due to navigational malfunctions, and crew members are normally repatriated home according to their wishes.
A South Korean fishing boat with four crew strayed north in July, and the North returned the crew a month later as part of a series of conciliatory gestures as U.N. sanctions took an increasingly tight hold on Pyongyang.
North Korea conducted a nuclear test and launched missiles this year, drawing U.N. Security Council sanctions that are believed to be further depleting its already dry coffers.
North Korea cut off dialogue and exchange with the South after a conservative leader took office in Seoul last year and stopped aid, demanding nuclear disarmament by Pyongyang.
