The company, which aims to be listed on the HKSE before June 30, 2010, said it would also consider whether it was appropriate to retain a listing in London.
The company, whose shares soared to a two-year high of 490 pence earlier in the day, also said it had amended its warrant instrument entered into with Credit Suisse in 2008 in preparation for the proposed listing.
Under the amendment, West China will redeem all of the 7.8 million warrants and take a related charge of $21.1 million in the second half of 2009 and a total charge of $30.2 million for the financial year.
The company said the loan, secured by a charge over 19.4 million shares, or a 29.9 percent stake, held by Chief Executive Jimin Zhang, was due for repayment nine months from the date of the utilisation or immediately upon its listing on the HKSE, whichever is earlier.
