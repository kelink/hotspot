UPDATE 3-LDK Solar puts COO in charge of all manufacturing
2009-10-13 18:24:00.0
(Reuters) - LDK Solar Co Ltd (
) said on Tuesday its senior vice president of manufacturing, Nicola Sarno, is leaving the company, sending its shares down 4 percent to $8.01 in after-hours trading.
The company said Sarno will "pursue personal interests" and that its president and chief operating officer, Xingxue Tong, will temporarily head all manufacturing operations, including polysilicon and wafer production.
LDK makes silicon wafers for the solar power industry and has offices in Xinyu City in China's Jiangxi Province and Sunnyvale, California.
Sarno joined the company in 2006 after spending nearly two decades with silicon maker MEMC Electronic Materials Inc WFR.N, according to LDK's website.
Sarno played a critical role in ramping up LDK Solar's polysilicon plant, which is a key part of its strategy.
"It's a loss for the company and it's unclear if they are going to be able to fill his shoes," said Colin Rusch, an analyst with ThinkEquity.
Sarno, whose resignation is effective Oct. 16, will continue to work in an "advisory role" on the polysilicon plant, the company said in a statement.
In August, LDK suffered a wider-than-expected quarterly loss after it took a large inventory writedown and forecast third-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates.
LDK shares were down at $8.01 in after-hours trading after closing at $8.35 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Laura Isensee; Editing by Braden Reddall, Andre Grenon, Tim Dobbyn)
