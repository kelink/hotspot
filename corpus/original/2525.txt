MUNICH - Siemens Chief Executive Peter Loescher is to leave the company, four years before the end of his contract, after the German engineering group this week issued its second profit warning this year.
NEW YORK - Small business owners plan for growth this year but are closely tracking recent interest rate rises and any impact they might have on their business and customers, according to a spot survey of firms in the New York region.

The second phase of the project for India's Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Limited (IL&FS) will include the addition of four generators each with a capacity of 660 megawatts (MW), the Chinese group said on its website.
The deal is an EPC contract, meaning Power Construction Corp will be responsible for engineering, procurement and construction. It said the project will create more than 10,000 jobs in India and use power equipment made in China.
China has been playing an active role in power project construction overseas, particularly in developing countries, taking advantage of state financing as well as experience and technology acquired through three decades of economic boom.
Power Construction Corp, a sprawling enterprise under the direct supervision of China's central government, was created through a state-dictated merger of dozens of domestic survey and design institutions, power construction companies and equipment manufacturers.
The group, with total assets of 196 billion yuan ($31 billion) and 200,000 employees at the end of 2010, said it generated total profits of 6.47 billion yuan on revenue of 160 billion in 2010.
IL&FS said it would import coal from Indonesia, Australia and South Africa to fuel the plant, the first phase of which included two generators each with capacity of 600 MW. It has acquired a mine in Indonesia to supply the generators.
Coal fuels more than half of India's power capacity of 191,000 MW and will be required for 85 percent of the 76,000 MW additional capacity targeted to be added in the next five years.
About 9,000 megawatts, nearly 10 percent of India's total coal-fired generating capacity, became unviable last year after Indonesia changed rules on coal prices. These plants have long-term agreements to sell power to states and no flexibility to pass on increased costs.
), which accounts for 80 percent of India's coal output, produced about 436 million tonnes in 2011/12, missing a scaled-down target. ($1 = 6.3073 Chinese yuan)
