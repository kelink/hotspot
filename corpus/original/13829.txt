(Reuters) - Two top U.S. venture capital firms, Sequoia Capital and Matrix Partners, teaming up with a Chinese investor, have agreed to invest around $15 million in a privately-held Chinese movie maker and distributor.
Poly Bona, often known as China's Miramax by industry magazines including Variety, recently completed Series B fundraising with the three investors, the company said in an emailed statement, which didn't name the Chinese investor.
In December 2008, Reuters reported that Poly Bona aimed to attract $30 million in a new round of fundraising, and that foreign investors including Goldman Sachs (
), Morgan Stanley (
Sequoia Capital and SIG Asia Investments, which is affiliated with Susquehanna International Group, are both Series A investors. SIG Asia did not participate in Series B fundraising for Beijing-based Poly Bona.
After the fundraising, Sequoia Capital, SIG Asia and Matrix Partners, which manages a $300 million China fund, would hold a seat on Poly Bona's seven-person board for each firm, according to the statement.
In 2007, Sequoia Capital and SIG Asia each invested $5 million in Poly Bona, which holds about a 20 percent share of the domestic movie distribution market.
Besides movie distribution, Poly Bona, established in 1999, has also invested in award-winning Chinese films including Red Cliff and The War Lords, according to its website (www.polybona.com.cn).
