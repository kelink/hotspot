), the world's largest iron ore producer, said on Thursday it expects metals markets to continue recovering as the world economy emerges from the financial crisis.
"Global industrial production has started to recover, that's clear, and our business is deeply connected to industrial production," said Vale CFO Fabio Barbosa in an investor conference call.
Barbosa and other company officials on the call pointed to iron ore spot market prices in China that are now above $90 per tonne and demand recovery for both non-ferrous metals, such as nickel, as well as stainless steel as signs of improvement.
Vale's share price was up 1.95 percent on Brazil's Bovespa stock exchange in morning trading, tracking a broad increase in commodities and equities prices around the world on Thursday.
Ferrous Minerals Director Jose Carlos Martins said Vale is now selling around 70 percent of its ore to China on a cost and freight basis, meaning the sender covers shipping, in efforts to ensure space in the growing Chinese market.
Previously Vale had said it only sold free on board, or FOB, in which the buyer paid the shipping costs.
The spot market price for Vale's ore in China is now above the benchmark sale price agreed on last year, he said.
China recently detained executives from Australia's Rio Tinto (
