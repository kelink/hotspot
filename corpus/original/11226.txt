(Reuters) - Publicis Group's (
) public relations and events arm is looking to double its revenue in three years through acquisitions and organically, the unit's chief executive said on Wednesday.
The PR and events unit of Publicis, the world's third-largest advertising group by revenue, is looking at completing two or three acquisitions by the end of the year, with a focus on Asia.
One of the acquisitions will be in China and will double the unit's headcount in the country to about 300, Olivier Fleurot told Reuters in an interview. "According to the discussions we are having we could do two or three acquisitions," Fleurot said.
