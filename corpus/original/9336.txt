(Reuters) - Agricultural company Bunge Ltd (
) reported a slight decline in third-quarter earnings and cut its full-year forecast on Thursday amid a weak market for its fertilizer, sending its shares down nearly 6 percent.
Net profit fell to $232 million, or $1.62 per share, from $234 million, or $1.70 a share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.47 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Revenue dropped 24 percent to $11.3 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $12.02 billion.
"Fertilizer results will be weaker than we previously expected due to a softer pricing environment both internationally and in Brazil," Chief Financial Officer Jacqualyn Fouse said in a statement.
Bunge, the largest producer and supplier of fertilizer in South America, said sales volumes of the products had increased seasonally in the third quarter, but were not as strong as expected.
Fertilizer sales in Brazil have been subdued by farmers' credit constraints. Also, farmers there are cutting back seedings of nutrient-intensive corn and cotton in favor of soybeans, which do not require as much fertilizer.
Bunge said agribusiness profit rose 73 percent to $294 million, while edible oil product profit reached $35 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $29 million.
Shares of Bunge were down 5.8 percent at $63.02 in premarket trading. The stock had hit a 7-1/2 week high early this week. (Reporting by Karl Plume; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
