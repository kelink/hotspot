(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures edged higher on Thursday following a rally in Chinese equities and ahead of data expected to show that jobless claims fell after a surprise increase in the prior period.
* A 20 percent fall in Chinese equities over the last two weeks sparked a wave of selling in global markets on fears that prices were too far ahead of the recovery. China's benchmark index
gained 4.5 percent on Thursday, easing some of those fears.
* "There are a lot of companies who carefully watch Chinese growth, particularly in the commodities sector. So it has a big impact on how people view stock valuation," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.
* Meckler said that with the rally in Chinese equities, bullish investors appeared to be back in the driver's seat. But he cautioned that volumes remained light due to the summer season, suggesting trading did not reflect decisions by big-money players.
* S&P 500 futures SPc1 rose 2.1 points, and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 gained 11 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures NDc1 were up 1.25 points.
* Economist forecast initial weekly jobless claims at 550,000, a decline from the previous week, when they posted a surprise rise, the first in seven weeks.
* In Europe, stocks
rose 1.3 percent, led by oil majors and banks, while Japan's Nikkei average
climbed 1.8 percent to bounce off a three-week closing low. (For details, see [ID:nLK399206])
* In the United States, NetApp Inc (
), a data storage equipment maker, fell in late trading after it reported a quarterly profit that topped Wall Street estimates but failed to give a forecast for the current quarter. [ID:nN19488190]
* Oil futures CLc1 fell 0.7 percent to below $72 a barrel Thursday after rising more than 4 percent the previous day, buoyed by industry data showing a steep drop in crude imports and stockpiles that might suggest an improving demand outlook.
* On Nasdaq, Goldman Sachs added Google Inc (
) to its Americas "conviction buy list" and maintained its 'buy' rating on the stock. Google rose 1.6 percent to $451.01 before the bell. Goldman's price target on the stock is $560. [ID:nBNG514815] (Reporting by Edward Krudy; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
