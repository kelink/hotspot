It is setting up a joint venture for $800 million in capital to proceed with the plan, which is subject to approval from South Korean and Chinese authorities, Samsung said.
Samsung's home rival LG Display (

Samsung's plant will use a 7.5-generation facility, capable of making large panels for popular LCD TVs. LG Display plans to build a slightly bigger eighth-generation factory.
Leading makers of liquid crystal display (LCD) panels are in a rush to set up production bases for China's fast-growing flat-screen TV market.
Research firm DisplaySearch said China could account for up to 20 percent of the global LCD TV market by 2011, up from 13 percent in 2008 and overtaking Western Europe as the world's No. 2 consumer after North America.
Japan's Sharp Corp (

Mainland playres are also in the game. China's BOE Technology Group (
