(Reuters) - The chairman of China's Hanlong Mining, which is bidding for Australia's Sundance Resources Ltd (
), is under police investigation for harboring his brother before the latter's arrest on suspicion of murder, local media reported on Saturday.
Liu Han was detained this week along with family members, according to local media reports. The official Xinhua news agency, quoting police sources, said on Saturday he was being investigated for possibly shielding evidence, among other "serious" criminal offences.
Sundance said on Wednesday it was not confident Hanlong would meet a deadline to prove financing for its $1.4 billion takeover bid after Han's reported detention.
Liu's younger brother, Liu Yong, is being investigated in relation to a triple homicide in 2009, according to local media reports. He was recently arrested by the police, Xinhua said.
