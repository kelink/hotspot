(Reuters) - Canada's Mercer International Inc (
) posted a narrower third-quarter loss, aided by strengthening pulp prices and strong demand from China, and said it remains optimistic on the short-term outlook for pulp prices.
The company posted a net loss attributable to common shareholders of 14.1 million euros, or 39 euro cents a share, compared with a net loss of 17.2 million euros, or 47 euro cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.
"In general, we are optimistic on the short-term outlook for pulp prices and believe that the sustainability of restarts and other high cost producers is possible only in a sustained higher pulp price environment," Chief Executive Jimmy Lee said in a statement.
Shares of the company closed at C$1.85 Wednesday on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
