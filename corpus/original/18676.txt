(Reuters) - The United States, Canada and Mexico vowed on Thursday to fight what they called unjustified bans on pork products in the wake of a H1N1 flu outbreak that started in Mexico.
In a joint statement, the three NAFTA nations called for an end to "unscientific bans on pork imports" over the outbreak of the disease, also known as swine flu.
"We urge our trading partners to remove these restrictions on our products immediately. We will continue to follow this situation closely, and will take any steps to prevent the enforcement of unjustified measures against our exports, as appropriate," the trio said.
This comment most likely refers to a possible challenge at the World Trade Organization, which can often be a long drawn out process. Russia is not a WTO member and could therefore, in theory, be subject to bilateral sanctions.
"These unjustified restrictions will likely result in serious trade disruptions without cause and result in significant economic damage," they said. (Reporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Jeffrey Hodgson)
