(Reuters)- The yuan traded at a record high against the dollar on Tuesday after the People's Bank of China set a new peak for the mid-point for the fourth straight session, following the dollar index falling to a three-week low.
Before trade began, the PBOC set the yuan's daily mid-point at a record high of 6.4845 against the dollar, from Monday's 6.4856. The central bank uses the mid-point to guide the currency.
Spot yuan hit a fresh peak of 6.4810 versus the dollar by midday compared with Monday's close of 6.4929. The Chinese currency has now appreciated 5.30 percent since it was depegged from the dollar in June 2010, and 1.65 percent since the start of this year.
The yuan has only risen 0.2 percent so far this month as a strong dollar has capped gains, but dealers expect the yuan could rise around 0.5 percent or further, underpinned by market expectations for a stronger Chinese currency in the long term as inflationary pressures linger.
It has risen 0.9 percent in April, extending a 0.4 rise in March.
"We have strong expectations for a further rise in the yuan because of the strong euro," said a dealer at a Chinese bank in Shenzhen. "The trend may mirror April's movements."
Offshore, one-year non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) were bid at 6.3620, little changed from 6.3600 at Monday's close. Their implied yuan appreciation in a year's time was 1.90 percent.
