LG Display swings to Q2 profit on strong TV demand

(Reuters) - South Korea's LG Display (
) returned to a quarterly profit after two straight quarters of losses, spurred by robust demand for flat-screen TVs and strong LCD panel prices due to shortages of key inputs.
The world's No. 2 maker of liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, used in television sets, posted on Thursday a 302 billion won ($238.5 million) net profit in the second quarter, much larger than a forecast of 161 billion won.
Operating profit in April-June was 218 billion won, also higher than a 157 billion won profit forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll.
The popularity of LCD TVs in North America and China is helping the industry rebound faster than expected from a slump in late 2008, and makers are scrambling to restart plants and secure raw materials. The sector is one of the few bright spots in a weak technology industry.
But the outlook is clouded due to rapid growth of output and a fragile global economy. Some analysts warned prices and sales may plummet in the fourth quarter when demand usually weakens. ($1=1266.1 Won) (Reporting by Rhee So-eui; Editing by Anshuman Daga and Jonathan Hopfner)
