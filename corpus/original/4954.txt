The announcement, which came on the eve of Chinese President Hu Jintao's state visit to Washington, showed China's currency practices remain a potent issue in Congress.
But both the Senate and the House of Representatives would have to approve the bill, and President Barack Obama would have to sign it, for it to become law.
Supporters claim wide support for the measure, but previous efforts to pass currency legislation directed at China have failed because of concerns it could trigger retaliation by Beijing, which is the biggest foreign holder of U.S. government debt.
-- The Treasury Department, in consultation with the International Monetary Fund, shall analyze the exchange rate policies of foreign countries on an annual basis.
-- Semiannual reports are due April 15 and October 15, although the reports are often delayed for political reasons as has been the case with the most recent report.
-- The reports examine whether countries are manipulating their currency's exchange rate with the U.S. dollar "for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade."
-- If manipulation is found, the Treasury secretary shall "initiate negotiations with such foreign countries on an expedited basis, in the International Monetary Fund or bilaterally, for the purpose of ensuring that such countries regularly and promptly adjust the rate of exchange between their currencies and the United States dollar."
-- The latter designation would trigger a priority investigation from the U.S. Commerce Department as to whether the undervaluation is an unfair subsidy for that country's exports at the expense of U.S. industry. It must then impose import duties to counteract the subsidy.
-- After 90 days of the designated country's failure to make appropriate policies, the U.S. must incorporate the currency undervaluation into its dumping calculations for products from that country.
-- Federal purchases of goods and services from the country would be prohibited unless the country is a member of the World Trade Organization's Government Procurement Agreement -- a provision aimed squarely at China.
-- After 360 days of failure to adopt appropriate policies, the U.S. Trade Representative must request WTO dispute settlement consultations with the designated country.
-- The U.S. president could put the process on hold after the initial 90 days of inaction if he determined that it would harm national security or the economic interests of the United States, but this must be explained and could be overridden by a congressional disapproval resolution.

Why does the US Senate, particularly Senator Schumer, not understand that the role of the US dollar as reserve and transactional currency is the problem? Why not follow the recommendation of the UN Stiglitz commission of 2009 for a non-national reserve currency and why not support Xiaochuan¡¯s and Russia¡¯s proposal of March 29, 2009 for the same monetary reform? The adoption of a SDR or similar synthetic trading currency would be a first step towards the final phase of monetary evolution which consists of an international monetary system that is based upon a carbon standard that would combat the climate crisis by advancing low carbon and climate-resilient development. Such system would provide a pathway to solving the problems of the unstable international monetary system, the disastrous consequences of the climate crisis and the inhuman conditions of two thirds of the human population on account of the ineffective models of development.
