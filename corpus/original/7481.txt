(Reuters) - The Export-Import Bank of China, one of the country's three policy lenders, and Bulgarian First Investment Bank FIB.BB plan to finance projects together, FIBank said on Friday.
FIBank, the sixth biggest bank in the European Union country, said it would become an agent of Exim Bank in Bulgaria under a signed partnership deal, the first of its kind between a Bulgarian and a Chinese bank.
"The two banks will support their operations and will fund together projects of mutual interest in Bulgaria, China and other countries," FIBank said in a statement.
The bank, one of the few in the Balkan country which is not a unit of a foreign lender, did not provide details.
Over 85 percent of the 29 banks operating in Bulgaria are foreign owned, mainly by EU-based lenders.
Exim Bank, which has total assets of 59 billion euros ($87.77 billion), is one of the key tools of the world's third largest economy to finance imports and exports of Chinese machinery and equipment, FIBank said.
Last week, the official China Daily said a unit of the country's sovereign wealth fund will inject capital into Exim Bank as soon as January [ID:nPEK136846].
Bulgaria, hard hit by the economic crisis has plunged into recession as foreign investors, mainly from the EU, fled the emerging economy.
