(Reuters) - Copper fell more than 3 percent to a three-week low on Monday, weighed by a strong dollar and demand worries that were reinforced by prospects that a Chinese stockpiling drive may have peaked.
The euro fell against the dollar ahead of the European Central Bank's first ever one-year refinancing operation on Wednesday. [USD/] A strong U.S. currency makes metals priced in dollars more expensive for holders of other currencies.
Copper for three month delivery MCU3 on the London Metal Exchange was last bid at $4,845 a tonne in rings from $5,025 at the close on Friday and compared with a session low at $4,830.
"Today is more a dollar story but also a bit of fatigue," Nick Moore, head of commodity strategy at RBS Global Banking & Markets, said.
"These commodities have had a superb first half ... (so it's) a nice pause before we get the run-up to the mating season in October."
Towards the end of the summer, metal producers and consumers start discussions over contracts and future prices, many of which culminate during LME Week in October.
Prices of the metal used in power and construction have gained about 60 percent this year, helped by Chinese stockpiling and improving economic data.
China's imports of refined copper hit a record for the fourth straight month in May, but apparent consumption fell 3.5 percent from the previous month, reflecting increased stockpiles and signalling lower inflows ahead. [ID:nHKG80221]
"Base metals couldn't get any positives from the Chinese customs data -- again showing a huge increase year-on-year," said Eugen Weinberg, an analyst at Commerzbank.
"It's not surprising because it's more or less in the price...imports will be very high given the high reserve purchases and also the arbitrage."

"People think in a year we'll be out of recession but until that time, markets remain nervous," an LME trader said. "We could see a 'W' shaped recovery."
Copper inventories fell 2,750 tonnes to 277,600 tonnes.
Aluminium lost 4.1 percent to a low of $1,610 but was last at $1,618 in LME rings versus $1,679. The metal, used in transport and packaging, has risen more than 14 percent this month and is on course for its biggest monthly gain since November 2001.
But on Friday, cancelled warrants fell to 96,025 tonnes compared with 124,850 tonnes on June 12, although LME aluminium stocks fell 7,300 tonnes to 4.36 million tonnes.
Aluminium prices were little affected by provisional figures from the International Aluminium Institute that showed daily average primary aluminium output fell to 63,600 tonnes in May from 64,000 tonnes in April.
