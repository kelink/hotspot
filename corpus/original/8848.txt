(Reuters) - Belgian wireless Internet device maker Option (
The shares, suspended in early trading, dived on resumption to a six-month low of 1.13 euros and were 11.9 percent lower at 1.26 euros by 1040 GMT.
Option, which makes cards, USB sticks and embedded modems that allow laptop users to surf the Internet at high speeds, has struggled to cope with a market that has shifted to high volumes and low margins.
Option, once the darling of the stock market, said it aimed to reduce annual operating expenses by 20 million euros ($29.48 million) in 2010. It had already reduced quarterly operating costs by 35 percent in the year to date.
This would include the lay-off of 55 staff at its headquarters in Belgium, further outsourcing to China and streamlined sales and marketing. A one-off restructuring charge of 7 million euros would be booked in the fourth quarter.
It would also be launching a 20 million euro capital increase, without giving further details.
"The revenues are frighteningly low. The only positive I can see is an improvement of the gross margin, but it is not enough to counter the decline of revenues," said Bart Jooris, analyst at BNP Paribas Fortis.
