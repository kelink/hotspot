(Reuters) - The decline in net interest margins that weighed on China Construction Bank's first-half earnings has almost bottomed out and the lender hopes to report a rise in profit for 2009, executives at the country's second-largest bank said on Monday.
The officials were briefing reporters in Beijing and Hong Kong on the bank's interim earnings, released on Friday. [ID:nHKG273680]
They said they were confident that CCB's (
) non-performing loans, and its NPL ratio, would decline over the rest of the year.
Lending, however, is set to slow sharply over the rest of 2009.
The bank is aiming to lend a total 900 billion yuan ($131.8 billion) over all of 2009, vice-president Zhu Xiaohang told reporters in Hong Kong.
After an increase in net loans of 716 billion yuan in the first half, this points to disbursements of less than 200 billion yuan in the second half of the year.
Chairman Guo Shuqing said in Beijing that CCB, in which Bank of America (
) holds a stake of about 11 percent, was keeping its business focused squarely on organic growth.
CCB's chief financial officer, Pang Xiusheng, said in Beijing that he hoped to be able to report an increase in full-year profit despite a drop in first-half earnings to 55.81 billion yuan from 58.67 billion a year earlier.
The decline reflected a drop in CCB's net interest margin to 2.46 percent at the end of June from 3.29 percent a year earlier.
That reduced the bank's net interest income to 102.47 billion yuan from 111.08 billion yuan
When asked about if net interest margin had bottomed out, Guo said: "Our sense is it has almost finished."
