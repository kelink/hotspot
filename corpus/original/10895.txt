(Reuters) - PTT Chemical PCL PTTC.BK, Thailand's largest olefins maker, said on Monday it expected 2010 revenue to rise 25 percent to more than 100 billion baht ($2.9 billion) after a new ethane cracker was completed later this year.
The new plant would raise its olefins capacity by 1 million tonnes to 2.9 million tonnes per year in 2010, President Veerasak Kositpaisal told reporters, adding the company forecast revenue of about 80 billion baht for 2009.
The forecast was based on the assumption that prices of plastic pellets should not be lower than $1,000 a tonne compared with current prices at $1,240 a tonne, he said.
His forecast was broadly in line with market expectations. The company is expected to post 2010 revenue of 109 billion baht, according to 13 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Despite new supplies from the Middle East, Veerasak said strong demand from China and the recovery of the global economy should help absorb the new capacity and keep prices at high levels.
Rising oil prices would also boost prices of petrochemical products, he said.
PTTCH, a flagship in the olefins petrochemical business of energy giant PTT PTT.BK, produces ethylene and propylene, together called olefins, used to make plastic pellets, especially for the packaging industry.
The new plant would enable it to produce linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) at 400,000 tonnes a year and its low density polyethylene (LPDE) plant would be completed in the second quarter of 2010 with annual capacity of 300,000 tonnes.
The company is also expanding annual capacity of its high density plastic pellets to 800,000 tonnes early next year from 500,000 tonnes now, he said.
On Monday, PTT Chemical shares closed unchanged at 66 baht, while the overall Thai stock market was 0.6 percent lower. ($1=33.98 Baht) (Reporting by Khettiya Jittapong; Editing by Alan Raybould)
