(Reuters) - Nomura Holdings, Japan's No. 1 brokerage, will establish a presence in China within the next year and a half to capture business, the chief operating officer of its wholesale business told Reuters.
Nomura is evaluating all its options in China, Jesse Bhattal said in an interview, when asked whether its push into Asia's biggest economy would be through a local tie-up.
"It is one of the most important geographies. We would like to over the next 12 to 18 months have a local market presence in China," Bhattal said.
The Japanese brokerage currently only has two representative offices in China, excluding Hong Kong: one in Beijing and one in Shanghai.
Bhattal also said Nomura was committed to keeping costs down as it paid for its overseas expansion. In the third quarter, personnel costs rose to 48 percent of the brokerage's revenue from 46 percent in the previous quarter, prompting concern among analysts that higher expenses would squeeze profits.
"Are we focused on costs? Yes, we are very focused on costs. Do we have the right discipline under it? Absolutely, we do," Bhattal said.
"The target is to be about 45 percent going forward. We are in growth mode and we are still building and that is something we are quite comfortable with," he added.
Nomura appointed Bhattal to its executive management board last year to run Nomura's wholesale business, which puts him at the forefront of the company's bid to become a top global investment bank.
Based in Hong Kong, Bhattal joined Nomura when the Japanese company bought the Asian and European operations of failed Lehman Brothers in 2008. Bhattal headed the Wall Street firm's Asia Pacific operations.
