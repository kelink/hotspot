China says finds no more excess toxins in milk

(Reuters) - China's quality watchdog said it has found no further problems with milk tainted by high levels of carcinogenic mildew in tests of products by major dairy producers.
Aflatoxin occurs naturally in the environment and is produced by certain common types of fungi. It can cause severe liver damage, including liver cancer.
The General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said in a statement late on Friday that checks covering other major producers "did not discover levels of aflatoxin which exceed standards."
The companies tested included Mengniu, Beijing Sangyuan Foods Co, Yili Industrial Group Co, Nestle SA and Bright Dairy & Food Co, it said.
The official Xinhua news agency, citing a quality watchdog official, said the toxin had originated from cows eating mildewed feed.
These incidents are the latest in a string of safety scandals to hit China's food industry in recent years.
In 2008, at least six children died and nearly 300,000 became ill in China from drinking powdered milk laced with melamine, an industrial chemical added to low-quality or diluted milk to give misleadingly high protein readings.
