UPDATE 1-China to let BEA, HSBC issue yuan bonds in Hong Kong
Tue  EDT
* HSBC, BEA to be first foreign lenders to issue yuan bonds
* Bonds will help set pricing benchmark for foreign banks (Recast with HSBC comment, analysts quotes)
) said on Tuesday their China units had won approval to issue yuan-denominated bonds in Hong Kong, the first foreign lenders to do so as China develops its off-shore yuan market.
Foreign banks, who have a limited network in China, typically rely on the interbank market and deposits as their main source of funding.
Five Chinese banks, including Bank of China (
), China Construction Bank (
) and China Development Bank, have issued yuan bonds in Hong Kong since 2007, when the government began allowing such issuance.
HSBC China President Richard Yorke said in a statement that the bank was working with China's regulators on the development of the RMB financial markets, both onshore and offshore.
"We believe that an RMB issue by HSBC China will help establish a representative pricing benchmark for foreign banks requiring funding," Yorke said.
Liao Qiang, analyst at ratings agency Standard & Poor's, said that although selling bonds in Hong Kong has become less attractive for Chinese banks since a string of interest rate cuts on the mainland, foreign lenders in China still see it as a relatively inexpensive means of fund-raising.
"For foreign banks such as Bank of East Asia and HSBC, they typically raise money through relatively high-yielding time deposits or via interbank borrowing, which is not a stable source of funding," Liao said.
"They would still like to issue bonds in Hong Kong, where there's a shortage of investment channels for yuan holders."
