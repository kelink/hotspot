), Taiwan's top credit card issuer, had originally bid for Nan Shan last year, but it lost out to a consortium including China Strategic and Primus Financial.
AIG said it "remains confident that regulatory authorities will approve the transaction. If the deal were not approved, AIG would evaluate its options to limit any long-term commitments from its continued ownership in Nan Shan," the insurer added.
AIG is also planning to list its Asian life insurance business, American International Assurance Co Ltd, on the Hong Kong stock exchange later this year to raise funds to pay back the U.S. government.
Nan Shan has more than 4 million policyholders, nearly one-sixth of Taiwan's population.
