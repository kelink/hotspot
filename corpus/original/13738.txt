(Reuters) - PC shipments in the Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan, grew 8 percent in the second quarter, the first year-on-year rise in three quarters, to reach 19.9 million units, IDC said.

"Ongoing consumer interest in portable PCs will continue to be the key moving forward, especially as both low-cost mini notebooks and new ultra-thin notebooks help to drive the market into next year."
Worldwide PC shipments fell about 3 percent from the year-ago quarter, which was better than its forecast of a more than 6 percent drop, IDC said last week. [ID:nN15184031] (US$1=T$33) (Reporting by Baker Li, Editing by Jonathan Hopfner)
