(Reuters) - World champion high hurdler Liu Xiang's return from the Achilles injury that destroyed his Beijing Olympic dream moved another step closer when he started training in spikes on Wednesday.
Liu, who celebrated his 26th birthday on Monday, has already written off defending his 110 metres hurdles world title in Berlin next month but aims to return to international competition at the Asian championships later this year, local media reported. "From this Wednesday, Liu will run with spiked shoes," his coach Sun Haiping told the Oriental Sports Daily.
"But it doesn't mean he is completely recovered. We can't be in such a hurry at present and we won't put a large training burden on him."
"Liu will take part in the National Games in October and it will be a warm-up for the Asian Championships in November," Sun added on the sports.cn website.
The 11th China National Games take place in Jinan from Oct. 11-23, while the Asian championships are in Guangzhou from Nov. 10-14.
