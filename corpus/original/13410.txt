U.S. must move faster on climate change: Sweden

(Reuters) - Sweden, which currently holds the European Union presidency, urged the United States on Thursday to move faster to tackle climate change ahead of a major environmental summit in Copenhagen later this year.
Andreas Carlgren, Environment Minister for Sweden, told journalists at a meeting of EU energy and environment ministers that he welcomed U.S. President Barack Obama's efforts to fight global warming but called on the United States to do even more.
"We welcome that the ambitions have changed dramatically compared to the previous administration, but still we expect more and we need more," he told reporters at a mountainside meeting held in central Sweden.
The French government last month criticized the United States and Canada for being too slow, saying they needed to do more to tackle greenhouse gases.
It warned that Canada and the United States were not on course to cut emissions by the level needed, making it difficult for rich nations to meet the 25-40 percent collective reduction in greenhouse gases recommended by a U.N. climate panel.
"We see within that bill the possibilities of raising the ambitions, and we are really urging our American friends to raise their bids and make sure that they can commit to more," he said
"The EU has so far put 20 percent on the table but we want that to go higher and we want to bring others with us," he said.
The United States, the world's second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China, signed but never ratified the Kyoto Protocol, a climate treaty to be renewed in global talks culminating at the Copenhagen conference.
"We want to speed up and the EU is now urgently calling on other parties to join us and to make sure that we can speed up and negotiations," he said.
