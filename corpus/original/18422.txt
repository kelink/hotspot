In the men's draw, ninth seeded Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga battled past his former idol Marat Safin 6-4 7-5 to set up a second-round clash with Croatian wild card Ivan Ljubicic.
Tsonga, 24, said he remembered watching the 29-year-old Safin, a former world number one, playing at the French Open and the Paris Masters, where the Russian won three times and finished runner-up once.
"For me he was like an idol before so it was really special to play against him and to win against him," Tsonga told a news conference.
"I liked his game but before everything his personality," he added. "Today I was happy with my game. I played great tennis, some good serves and volleys, and I was really aggressive so I'm happy today."
In the women's draw, Elena Dementieva's bid for a third title this season gathered pace when the Russian third seed defeated Lourdes Dominguez Lino of Spain 6-3 6-2 in a match that ended shortly before midnight local time.
Men's top seed and world number one Rafael Nadal begins his quest for a sixth title of the year, and a fourth on clay, later this week against the winner of the first-round clash between Juergen Melzer and Albert Montanes.
World number two Roger Federer and newly-installed number three Andy Murray are both in action in the second round on Tuesday and women's world number one Dinara Safina, who also had a bye into the second round, is due to play China's Li Na.
