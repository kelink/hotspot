Washington and Beijing have clashed this year over issues including the value of China's currency, U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and U.S. President Barack Obama's February meeting with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader.
China's relations with its neighbors have also been strained by territorial disputes -- notably with Japan -- but also with South East Asian nations who have competing claims over the South China Sea.
The top U.S. diplomat, starting a trip to seven Asia-Pacific nations including China, sought to strike a balance between the U.S. desire to work with Beijing and its concerns about some Chinese policies.
"The relationship between China and the United States is complex and of enormous consequence and we are committed to getting it right," Clinton said in a speech on U.S. Asia-Pacific policy delivered in Honolulu.
"There are some in both countries who believe that China's interests and ours are fundamentally at odds. They apply a zero-sum calculation ... so whenever one of us succeeds, the other must fail," she said. "But that is not our view."
While saying the two nations work together on many issues, Clinton also alluded to their many differences, including U.S. desires to see the Chinese currency appreciate as well as U.S. criticism of China's human rights record.
"There are also many in China who still believe that the U.S. is bent on containing China and I would simply point out that since the beginning of our diplomatic relations, China has experienced breathtaking growth and development," she said.
"This is due, of course, to the hard work of the Chinese people. But U.S. policy has consistently -- through Republican and Democratic administrations and Congresses -- supported this goal since the 1970s," she said.
Clinton's trip began on Wednesday with a stop in Hawaii to meet Japan's foreign minister. On Thursday she continues to Vietnam for the East Asia summit and then heads to Cambodia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand and Australia.
While China was not originally on her itinerary, the State Department added a last-minute detour to China's Hainan Island on Saturday so Clinton could meet Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo, a key figure in managing the strained U.S.-China relationship who will not attend the summit in Hanoi.
Reports that China had curtailed its exports of so-called rare earth minerals, vital for the production of high-tech goods, to Japan following the dispute have rattled policy makers and markets fearing a scarcity of the commodities.
Clinton's speech made no reference to that dispute, but she made clear the U.S. view that China and its neighbors should work cooperatively to resolve their territorial disputes.
In Hanoi in July, Clinton signaled new U.S. engagement in the South China Sea issue, emphasizing that Washington believed territorial disputes in the region had global implications because of its key role as a trade and shipping crossroads and potentially rich source of natural resources.
Built around this week's East Asia Summit in Hanoi, the Clinton's two-week trip is designed to demonstrate the U.S. commitment to the region as the United States, and other nations in the region, grapple with China's economic and military rise.
"There are some who say that this long legacy of American leadership in Asia Pacific is coming to a close -- that we are not here to stay. I say look at our record. It tells a very different story," Clinton said. "We are focused on a distant time horizon -- one that stretches out for decades to come."
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
¡°U.S. not seeking to ¡®contain¡¯ China: Clinton¡± We don¡¯t want to, but they have forced our hand with this rare earth element debacle. We can¡¯t practice ¡°free trade¡± with folks who will use a stranglehold on supply chains as a political weapon. Free trade must go both ways, and bad actors must be punished. China has become a bad actor of late, and must be punished.

Free trade? You mean China can buy stuff freely from US? You mean China can invest freely in the US.? Don¡¯t be a hypocrite! Things do work both ways! One of the reasons China ends up with a bunch of potentially useless US dollars is that they can¡¯t buy much of anything from US. Please please don¡¯t say that they can buy stuff they already make in abundance! China sends stuff that ordinary American needs. In return, they end up with a bunch of IOUs. I¡¯m certain that the ordinary Chinese are sick and tired of subsidizing the lifestyle we actually can¡¯t afford! Don¡¯t complain. Learn to appreciate! I don¡¯t believe China sells anything to the US under gun points!!! ¡°United States was not seeking to contain China¡±? It¡¯s important to have deeds instead of talks. Granted, China isn¡¯t helping much in US international affairs. However, Americans must recognize what they are doing for Chinese interests internationally. Things do work both ways!
