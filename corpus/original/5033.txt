Japan PM's new No. 2 seeks win-win ties with China

(Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan's new de facto deputy, who last year called China a "bad neighbor" for its tough stance in a diplomatic row, said on Friday he wanted to seek mutually beneficial relations with Beijing.
Kan appointed Yukio Edano as chief cabinet secretary after opposition parties threatened to boycott debate in parliament on the budget for the year from April unless his predecessor, Yoshito Sengoku, was sacked.
"Between China and Japan there are many issues that need to be resolved, as well as those on which the two countries hold different positions," Edano told a news conference.
"I will insist on non-negotiable issues that are in Japan's national interest, but I think we can repair ties as we work to build win-win cooperative ties over issues on which the two countries share interests."
Relations between Japan and China soured last year after Tokyo arrested a Chinese fishing trawler captain whose boat collided with Japanese patrol vessels near disputed isles in the South China sea. Beijing reacted harshly, even after the captain was released, although ties have thawed somewhat since then.
Sengoku was censured by the opposition-controlled upper house for his handling of the row. The government came under fire for appearing to cave in to China's demands to release the skipper.
