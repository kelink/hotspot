), the South China Morning Post reported on Wednesday.
The latest tender was the third by China Mobile for its third-generation network covering 200 mainland cities, involving the installation of 39,000 base stations, the report said.
The rest of the contracts went to Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] , which won 22 percent, Datang Mobile Communications Equipment and domestic partner FibreHome Technologies, with a 21 percent share. Nokia Siemens Networks [NOKI.UL] with 7 percent, and China Putian, New Postcom and Ericsson, each won 5 to 6 percent.
China Mobile, the world's largest mobile service provider by users, holds the sole government licence to develop and operate the nation's homegrown TD-SCDMA technology.
"Vendors with a self-developed capability in TD-SCDMA technology scored higher marks in all three phases of TD-SCDMA tenders," 3TelConsulting, a mainland telecommunications industry research firm, was quoted by the newspaper as saying.
ZTE and Huawei were helped by their offers of a free upgrade of China Mobile's existing TD-SCDMA equipment, which was installed in the previous two phases of network construction, the report said, quoting analysts.
ZTE, the world's sixth-largest cellphone maker, has said it aims to become of the top three vendors in five years, although analysts expect the cellphone market to have its toughest year ever in 2009, with sales volumes shrinking 10 percent or more.
