(Reuters) - Chinese stocks sank 1.91 percent on Friday, their biggest daily drop in one month, as expectations mounted of an imminent resumption of initial public offerings, which could include a large offering.
The slump in China stocks pushed Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index off the nine-month high it hit earlier in the day but the index managed to eke out a 0.5 percent gain, rising for a third day in a row and a fourth straight week.

"Pushing the index above 19,000 points was crucial to creating the impression that this is a bull market," said DBS Vickers director Peter Lai.
"But at this level, selling pressure is very high. Funds that bought into the market at 12,000-13,000 points have already begun to take profit," he said.

HSBC shares were raised to an "outperform" rating from "neutral" by Credit Suisse on Thursday with a target price of HK$84, as it is seen to be less vulnerable to the margin pressure on European banks in the medium term.
