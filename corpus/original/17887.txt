Konica Minolta: LCD film demand to boost earnings
2009-05-20 06:37:00.0
(Reuters) - Japan's Konica Minolta Holdings Inc (
) said a recent strong recovery in demand for its high-tech film used in LCD panels is likely to boost its annual earnings, although it has no plan to increase its outlook now. Robust flat TV sales in China, spurred by the government's stimulus package, and the completion of panel inventory adjustments have created fresh LCD panel demand, which has led to brisk orders for its LCD film, Konica Minolta Senior Executive Officer Shoei Yamana told the Reuters Global Technology Summit in Tokyo.
Its triacetyl cellulose (TAC) film, which protects the polarisation plate used in LCD panels, had been an engine of growth for Konica Minolta until global LCD TV demand slowed last year due to the economic downturn.
"Adjustment of bloated panel inventory has pretty much run its course and now panel makers are boosting production to meet strong demand from China. We are experiencing a knock-on effect from all this," Yamana said.
