(Reuters) - Canadian gold exploration company Klondex Mines Ltd (
Earlier this month, Canada's Silvercorp Metals launched an unsolicited, all-stock bid for Klondex in an attempt to expand its portfolio and increase its geographic diversification.
The offer calls for the exchange of 0.5 common share of Vancouver, British Columbia-based Silvercorp for each Klondex common share. Based on Monday's close, it values Klondex at C$2.12 per share, or about C$68 million.
Klondex said its directors and officers will neither accept the Silvercorp offer nor tender their shares to the Silvercorp offer. Klondex's management exercise control over almost 20 percent of the company's shares on a fully diluted basis.
The Klondex board said Silvercorp's offer significantly undervalues Klondex's assets. The company also said it was pursuing alternative transactions.
Klondex said proceeds of this financing, combined with the C$1 million generated from its recent stock option and warrant exercises, will fund the company's near-term operations. (Reporting by Euan Rocha, editing by Maureen Bavdek)
