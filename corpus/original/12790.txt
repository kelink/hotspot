(Reuters) - British chemicals maker Elementis Plc (
) said on Monday that growth in Asian markets would help to pick up slack from weak demand in Europe and North America, as shareholders brushed off its first-half losses.
It posted first-half pretax losses of 30.2 million pounds ($50.6 million), compared with profit of 26.8 million last time. That was largely due to exceptional charges for closing its UK chromium facility and the cost of cancelling currency hedging contracts.
Stripping out the exceptional costs of 32.4 million pounds, Elementis posted pretax profit of 2.2 million pounds.
The firm, which makes chemicals to enhance the texture of paints and cosmetics, said sales were 28 percent lower than the previous year at 172.2 million pounds.
Finance Director Brian Taylorson said the effect of global destocking in the first half had largely played itself out and was optimistic about growth opportunities in Asia-Pacific, which accounts for about a third of its business.
"We are seeing normal demand patterns (in Europe and North America), albeit at much lower levels than last year," he said.
"The access to China has helped offset some of the downturn effect you saw in the early part of the year," he added.
The purchase of Taiwan-based Deuchem, a supplier for the Asia-Pacific markets, paid off in the first of half of 2009, with operating margins of over 10 percent, Taylorson said.
Looking ahead, the company said trading would be in line with management's expectations.
"While there remains a degree of uncertainty in the current economic environment, trading nevertheless remains in line with the Board's expectations," the group said. (Reporting by Nicholas Vinocur; Editing by Mariam Karouny) ($1=.5972 Pound)
