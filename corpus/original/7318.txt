Sinochem cuts offer for Nufarm to A$12/share

(Reuters) - China's Sinochem cut its proposed takeover offer for Australia's Nufarm Ltd (
) by 7.7 percent to A$2.6 billion ($2.3 billion) on Tuesday, a move that could force Nufarm to walk away, casting doubt on Sinochem's expansion plans.
The revised offer values Nufarm at A$12.00 per share, down from A$13.00, and comes after Sinochem failed to meet an initial deadline to sign a binding agreement. The two companies had extended talks to December 23.
Sinochem, which is looking to gain a global footprint, made its initial offer in September, but a series of profit downgrades by Nufarm this year has cast doubt about Sinochem's commitment to the deal.
Nufarm's Chairman Kerry Hoggard said the company was disappointed that Sinochem has been unable to confirm its intention to proceed with an acquisition on the basis that was previously agreed.
Nufarm's shares never traded above the Sinochem's initial offer price of A$13 each, reflecting the market's concerns about the long-awaited deal. The deal is also subject to regulatory approvals.
"We are disappointed they have reduced it, but we will wait and see what the company recommends," said Ross Barker, managing director of Nufarm shareholder Australian Foundation Investment Co.
"We like our investment in Nufarm and we are not very keen sellers," he said.
Earlier this month, Nufarm said it would not accept anything less than A$13 a share.
In 2007, Nufarm was approached by another Chinese suitor, China National Chemical Corp (ChemChina), which led a A$3 billion approach with two U.S. private equity firms, but they failed to come up with a formal offer.
