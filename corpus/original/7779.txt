UPDATE 2-Aveva on track for full-year; shares up

(Reuters) - British engineering software firm Aveva Group (
) posted a smaller-than-expected fall in profit on Thursday, as a resilient oil and gas market partly compensated for weakness in ship building.
The company, whose software is used to design ships, oil and gas projects and nuclear power stations, said although it remained cautious, it was well positioned to trade successfully through the global downturn.
"We have been investing in areas where we do still see strong growth, particularly in China, in Russia and especially Brazil, which has become a very big focus for us with offshore oil and gas," said Chief Executive Richard Longdon in a call with reporters.
"Overall, we are very positive about our situation."
Shares in Aveva, up 60 percent since the start of the year, were 6.1 percent higher at 970.5 pence by 1221 GMT, as analysts said the firm was on track to meet or beat year estimates.
Seymour Pierce, which upgraded the company to "Hold" from "Underperform", said the results showed some resilience in revenue and earnings, while Panmure Gordon said they were in line with its recently upgraded estimates.
"This morning's narrative suggests a broader operational improvement in oil and gas, power having potential and marine poor as expected," Panmure's George O'Connor said in a note.
Analysts expect full-year revenue to fall 15 percent to 140 million pounds, while pretax profit is forecast to decline 29 percent to 44 million pounds, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Longdon said he didn't expect to see a recovery in marine until 2011, but its shipbuilding customers were still completing orders from their backlog.
"We've not had customers going bust on us or not paying," he said. "We can tread water in that market and just wait for the upturn."
