AIG is pursuing divestitures as part of its plan to pay back U.S. taxpayers, which have a roughly 80 percent stake in AIG, after providing some $180 billion since last September to save the insurer from bankruptcy. The New York-based company has more than $80 billion in outstanding loans from the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury. But net proceeds of asset sales have been slow to make a dent in its debt. In the first seven months of 2009, AIG was able to reach agreements to generate about $2.6 billion in net after-tax proceeds available for repayment of its Federal Reserve loan, it said last Friday. Below are some of the deals AIG has announced: ASSET BUYER PRICE AIG Finance (Hong Kong) China Construction Bank $70 mln* AIG FP energy investments Various $1.9 bln U.S. life finance biz Unit of Wintrust Financial$679.5 mln Transatlantic Hldgs stake Public offering of shares $1.1 bln Office bldg, Tokyo Nippon Life Insurance $1.2 bln 21st Century Insurance Zurich Financial $1.9 bln Unibanco AIG Seguros Unibanco $820 mln Hartford Steam Munich Re $739 mln AIG Life of Canada BMO Financial Group $263 mln AIG Private Bank Aabar Investments $253 mln * Deal also includes repayment of intragroup debt and deposits of about $557 million Below are other recent developments that could result in sales of major AIG assets: * AIG has formed special purpose companies to hold the equity of two of its biggest life insurers, American Life Insurance Co (Alico) and American International Assurance (AIA).

Both businesses could be sold through initial public offerings.
