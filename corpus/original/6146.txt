China's move over the weekend initially ignited a wave of euphoria across financial markets on optimism that a stronger yuan would lift China's purchasing power for foreign goods such as commodities, a boon to the global economy given China's huge demand for raw materials.
But as trading progressed, markets gave back much of their gains on worries that China may do little to its currency that could be meaningful for the global economic recovery in the short term.
The U.S. dollar rose late in the day as investors took profits from a risk-currency rally, while the Australian and New Zealand dollars, considered part of the commodity bloc, paired gains as the yuan-induced euphoria faded.
Copper and oil prices, which surged on expectations of increased appetite for natural resources in the world's third-largest economy, gave back about half their earlier gains.
"It's basically inertia where the moves are not progressing and people have turned around and took it the other way. I would say the lack of follow-through after the China-fueled rally is leading to some risk aversion," said Brian Dolan, currency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Easing the currency peg is a move to allow China's economy to be driven less by the export of goods abroad and more by domestic consumer spending. The move came ahead of a meeting next week of the Group of 20 leading industrialized and developing economies, where global trade imbalances are expected to be a key issue.
U.S. stocks ended lower, reversing gains that earlier had driven the three major indexes up by more than 1 percent.
closed down 8.23 points, or 0.08 percent, at 10,442.41. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
fell 4.31 points, or 0.39 percent, at 1,113.20. The Nasdaq Composite Index
dropped 20.71 points, or 0.90 percent, at 2,289.09.
"The announcement was considered to be constructive, but markets were unable to sustain that euphoria as they looked at the details," said John Brady, senior vice president at MF Global in Chicago.
) which had gained as much as 2.6 percent, ended up just 0.2 percent at $66.07. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc (
) which jumped 6 percent, closed up 2.18 percent to $68.08.
"It seems everything in the low-cost retailers is made in China," said Brian Gendreau, market strategist affiliated with Financial Network Investment Corporation in El Segundo, California.
The MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS rose 1.6 percent, while the FTSEurofirst 300 index
rose for a ninth straight session to close 1 percent higher at 1,055.38 points, the highest close since early May, with basic resources stocks the biggest gainers.
Emerging stocks .MSCIEF added 2.4 percent to a six-week high, while emerging sovereign debt spreads tightened 8 basis points to 303 bps, their narrowest in five weeks.
U.S. crude oil ended up 0.83 percent at $77.82 a barrel, while spot gold fell nearly 2 percent, its biggest one-day drop in more than a month after a sudden decline of the euro prompted investors to take profits from all-time highs set earlier.
China is the world's second biggest energy consumer after the United States.
Copper prices gave back some of its earlier gains as China, the world's largest consumer of industrial metals, may do little to its currency of meaningful effect in the short-term.
"That's why people are a bit cautious," said Wayne Atwell, managing director at New York-based investment bank Casimir Capital LP. "If it's 10 percent, then it's a different story altogether."
Benchmark lead on the London Metal Exchange touched $1,837.75 a tonne, its highest since May 28, before closing at $1,833, up $88. Tin reached $18,250, matching a high on May 28, before closing at $17,800/17,900 from $17,450.
The single European currency initially extended last week's recovery against the dollar, at one point rising to a one-month high, but gains faded as the New York session got under way.
The euro was last down 0.52 percent at $1.2320. The dollar rose against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY up 0.30 percent at 85.953.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 6/32, with the yield at 3.2469 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note was down 1/32, with the yield at 0.7175 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 10/32, with the yield at 4.1653 percent.
Breaking the peg might mean China needs to buy less U.S. dollars in intervention, which would leave it with fewer dollars to buy U.S. Treasuries, but also give it less need to diversify its holdings into currencies like the euro.
