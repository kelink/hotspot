) in Nigeria said on Wednesday the bank had a strong preference for organic growth, despite an opportunity for foreigners to buy into five banks rescued in a bailout.
The central bank injected 400 billion naira ($2.6 billion) into Afribank AFRB.LG, Finbank FIBP.LG, Intercontinental Bank INBK.LG, Oceanic Bank OCBK.LG and Union Bank UBNP.LG on Aug. 14 and sacked their senior management, saying lax governance had left them dangerously undercapitalised.
"From the point of view of percentage acquisitions that the government would like to see, or at least investment by foreign banks into domestic banks, we have a very strong preference for organic growth," Christopher Knight, managing director of Standard Chartered in Nigeria, told reporters.
"We do look at acquisitions when they fill a gap in a product or service or geographic coverage in a particular country ... We are happy with our organic growth and we will just see how things go," he said.
Nigerian Central Bank Governor Lamido Sanusi will meet with international banks, lenders and rating agencies in London on Friday to discuss the bank bailout.
Sanusi told Reuters in an interview last week that his preference was to have the rescued banks valued properly and purchased by other banks, rather than other options including setting up an asset management company to soak up bad loans. [ID:nLK118482]
Some analysts say Sanusi's move may give foreigners a golden chance to enter Africa's most populous nation, seen as a "must have" for emerging markets lenders wanting to gain a foothold or expand their presence on the continent. [ID:nLH19935]
Standard Chartered is an Asia-focused bank and is currently in talks about small acquisitions in China and India. [ID:nL4317381]. (For more Reuters Africa coverage and to have your say on the top issues, visit:
