METALS-Copper up near 2-wk high, economic jitters persist

(Reuters) - Copper climbed to its highest level in nearly two weeks on Thursday, driven by strong technical momentum and economic optimism that helped drive sharp gains in equities and metals, alike.
Copper for September delivery HGU9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division rose 3.50 cents to settle at $2.3160 a lb, after dealing between $2.2450 and $2.3465, its highest level since June 15.
"When we took out yesterday's high ($2.3020 a lb), that was significant and we saw more upside interest in the market once that occurred," said Larry Young, senior trader at Infinity Futures Inc in Chicago.
"Keep in mind we have the end of the second quarter coming up next week and have had a really good quarter in terms of the metals, so I wouldn't be surprised to see prices sell off maybe by tomorrow or early next week as some funds book profits," he added.
On the London Metal Exchange (LME), copper for three-month delivery MCU3 closed up $75 at $5,130 a tonne. Earlier, the metal used in power and construction hit a day's high of $5,145, its highest since June 15.
"It seems most recently the market has been perhaps responding more to technical considerations and the dollar," said John Gross, publisher of the Copper Journal.
The dollar fell against most major currencies on Thursday, as a rally in U.S. equities reduced the greenback's safe-haven bid, making dollar-priced commodities more attractive. [USD/]
"It looks like some new optimism rushing through markets," said Robin Bhar, an analyst at Calyon. "U.S. stocks have held their ground pretty well."
"And there's no real sense that there has to be any upward move in U.S. interest rates," Bhar also said of the positive market sentiment.
BETTER DAYS AHEAD?
"Investors must now start to look for a protracted downturn and while there are a few signs of recovery in parts of the economy, there is not enough tangible evidence to be sure that we're coming out of recession later this year," said John Meyer, an analyst at investment bank Fairfax.
Copper has risen about 60 percent so far in 2009, driven by aggressive buying by China, the world's top copper consumer.
Copper's near-term picture remains muddied as China's stockpiling phase tails off and Western economies, still crippled by the economic slowdown, are not expected to pick up the baton any time soon.
Positive for prices, copper stocks continued their downward trend, falling 3,450 tonnes to 271,600 tonnes -- their lowest since mid-November.
Aluminum, used in transport and packaging, was $1,684 from $1,660 a tonne. Total LME stocks of the metal slipped 6,150 tonnes but remain near record levels above 4.3 million tonnes.
Helping to support aluminum, on course for its biggest monthly gain since May 1988, were worries about a shortage as many companies with metal are using it as collateral to release cash tied up in stocks. [ID:nLF699919]
Steel-making ingredient nickel MNI3 closed at $15,625 from $15,500 and battery material lead MPB3 was last quoted at $1,738/1,739 from $1,705.
Zinc MZN3 was last quoted at $1,643/1,645 from $1,611 a tonne, while tin MSN3 was last quoted at $14,825/14,850 from $14,750.
Canceled warrants for tin were 1,280 tonnes on Wednesday, about 7 percent of LME stocks currently at 17,090 tonnes -- this suggests that a large percentage of LME inventories are earmarked for delivery. Metal Prices at 1903 GMT Metal Last Change Pct Move End 2008 Ytd Pct
