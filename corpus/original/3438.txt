(Reuters) - China called on Tokyo on Tuesday to quickly and appropriately resolve the arrest of a Chinese fishing boat captain who refused to heed a coast guard inspection order in Japan's territorial waters.
The boat was spotted by the coast guard near the Goto islands off Nagasaki in southwestern Japan and asked to stop with commands and signs in Chinese, but the vessel ignored the call, the Nagasaki Coast Guard Office said.
"China has noted relevant reports and is currently investigating and verifying the situation," foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a daily news briefing.
This time, however, the Chinese ship was detained in an area that is not a subject of territorial disputes, the coast guard said, and governments and media of both nations have reacted with restraint.
Unlike the boat's captain, who was brought to Nagasaki on Sunday evening for questioning, none of the crew members had been arrested, but will probably be questioned about the incident.
The two countries are at odds over China's exploration for natural gas in the East China Sea. In 2008, they agreed on principle to resolve the feud by jointly developing gas fields.
The seas are at the center of a territorial dispute between the two countries focused on a group of uninhabited islets, known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China.
