Husky plans $1 bln spinoff in HK, Toronto - report
HONG KONG, June 1

HONG KONG, June 1
), a Canadian oil company controlled by tycoon Li Ka-shing, plans a dual listing for its Asian assets in Hong Kong and Toronto next year, a move that could raise up to US$1 billion, the South China Morning Post reported on Monday.
Husky might award a mandate for sale by the end of this month after meetings with investment banks including JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs in recent weeks, the newspaper said citing market sources.
The spinoff unit, with a total estimated value of about US$4 billion, will sell about 25 percent to the public, but parent Hutchison Whampoa (
) has yet to make a final decision on the offering, the sources said.
"It (the spinoff) is likely in the future," Hutchison spokewoman Laura Cheung said. She declined to comment on the newspaper report.
Husky owns seven exploration blocks off the coast of China, and the Liwan field, which is southeast of Hong Kong and is estimated to contain up to 6 trillion cublic feet of natural gas, the newspaper said.
In April, Husky Energy CEO John Lau said the company planned to spin off its Southeast Asian assets, including the huge Liwan gas field, into a separate company to boost its share value once it saw some economic stability. [ID:nN21492911]
The new company would be listed on an Asian stock exchange, have its own management and board, and require little capital from Husky, Lau added. (US$1=HK$7.8) (Reporting by Donny Kwok; editing by Chris Lewis)
