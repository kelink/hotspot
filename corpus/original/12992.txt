Gold steadies as dollar, stocks eyed, ETF falls

(Reuters) - Gold prices steadied on Thursday, holding above a two-week low hit the previous day as investors watched the dollar and stocks to gauge risk appetite.
Gold is now 3 percent below the six-week high hit on Monday, as U.S. durable goods orders data dampened optimism about an economic recovery and prompted investors to trim risk assets including commodities and to buy the dollar as a safe haven.
Given slack physical demand, the market was more likely to slide toward $900, a level where physical demand has typically picked up this year, than test the upside, traders said.
"The fact that the market couldn't hold on to $950-$960 levels suggests the market's recent rally was not substantiated, given a lack of physical demand," said Yuichi Ikemizu, Tokyo branch manager at Standard Bank Plc.
"There has been very little sign of such physical buying and the market will likely extend losses until they step in," which has been around $900 when big Asian buyers such as India, China and Vietnam, and even Japan, purchased gold, he said.
Spot gold was at $930.50 per ounce as of 0325 GMT, up 0.2 percent from New York's notional close of $929.00. Gold prices fell to around $925 on Wednesday, the lowest since July 15, as rising risk aversion boosted the dollar after U.S. durable goods orders fell more than forecast.
U.S. gold futures for August delivery inched up 0.3 percent to $930.30 per ounce, compared to $927.20 an ounce on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The COMEX gold range low of $925.20 dated back to July 15 and fell from a lower high at $940.90 an ounce.
Ikemizu said the market looked long overall, with over 100 tonnes of COMEX long positions estimated currently, although the amount may have dropped as the market had fallen in the past few days.
Technically, gold has fallen below the 20-day moving average, effective around $933 an ounce on Thursday.
Reflecting bearish market sentiment, holdings at the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, the SPDR Gold Trust, fell 10.38 tonnes or about 1 percent to 1,072.87 tonnes as of July 29 from the previous business day.
SPDR has shed about 53 tonnes over the past month, the largest drop ever for the fund.
"The rise in SPDR holdings has been a major factor driving the market higher and if the fund is now turning around to be a seller, that would be a major bear factor," Ikemizu said.
The dollar held steady against the euro on Thursday, after advancing to a two-week high against the single currency the day before when steep losses in Shanghai's stock market and an unexpectedly weak U.S. durable goods report bolstered the greenback's appeal as a safe haven.
