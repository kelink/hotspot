India seeks more talks on contentious climate draft

(Reuters) - Indian negotiators have played down a proposal for major economies to consider setting a goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, saying there were contentious ideas in the draft on the cuts needed.
The proposal is part of a draft document put forward by the United States and Mexico at talks in Mexico this week, without reaching an accord.
But Indian negotiators returning from Mexico said there was no consensus over the draft text and many hurdles remained, especially on the scope of emission cuts for different countries.
"There are differences on some of these issues, so it's not a consensus text that is ready to be adopted in one more meeting," the official told Reuters on Friday on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters.
The two-page draft declaration does not set clear goals but says that developed countries, including the United States, the European Union and Japan, would "undertake robust aggregate and individual mid-term reductions in the 2020 timeframe."
The Indian negotiators said there was broad consensus on the need for more funding for climate change adaptation and the transfer of clean-energy technology, but there were differences of opinion on the amount and how to disburse the money.
"More than the volume of funds it's the delivery mechanism, the commitment that is important," one of the negotiators said.
