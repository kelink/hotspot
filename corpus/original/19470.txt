METALS-Industrial metals fall as flu fears hit markets

(Reuters) - Growing anxieties about a global outbreak of swine flu and its impact to thwart any potential economic recovery drove industrial metal prices lower on Monday, with copper sinking to its lowest level in three weeks.
"This swine flu news on top of the recession is really pushing everything down," said Zachary Oxman, managing director with TrendMax Futures in Encinitas, California. "I think the markets are trying to draft what this 'pandemic' really could be and if it's going to be as bad as it is ... but I think commodity markets might be over-doing it a bit."
Copper for July delivery HGN9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division slipped 6.45 cents, or over 3 percent, to settle at $1.9855 a lb, its lowest level on a closing basis since April 6.
On the London Metal Exchange (LME), copper for three-months delivery MCU3 ended down $120 at $4,350 a tonne. Earlier, it hit a near three-week low of $4,252.
In other metals, battery material lead MPB3 fell 6.5 percent to a day's low of $1,341.50 a tonne before closing down $75 at $1,360. Nickel MNI3 fell $175 to end at $11,375 a tonne after hitting a day's low of $10,930.
"Nobody knows what is going to happen with the swine flu," said Dan Smith, analyst at Standard Chartered. "People have got a bit optimistic in terms of risk-appetite, so we've seen a significant reversal of that in the last day or so."
"There have been quite a few positives in the market in terms of China, but the rest of the world has remained poor."

A pandemic would deal a major blow to a world economy already suffering its worst crisis in decades, and experts say it could cost trillions of dollars.
Wall Street surrendered gains in late business on Monday, following lower sessions in Europe and Asia on concerns the flu outbreak could place a further strain on global economies. [.N]
"Investors in Asia are all the more aware of the potential damage after the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong six years ago hobbled the city and regional economy, as well as flare-ups of bird flu in the past few years," RBC Capital said in a note.
"Stocks are falling rapidly and that is leading to tightness," said Robin Bhar, an analyst at Calyon. "It relates to the fact that there's a lot of material that's been canceled and will leave the warehouses and be probably shipped to China."
He added that backwardation normally occurs in markets in a strong global economic environment, but the current anomaly in copper is due to a recent trend of demand from China.
LME copper stocks fell by 4,275 tonnes to a three-month low of 425,275 tonnes.
Canceled warrants - material tagged for delivery - stood at 67,600 tonnes, up from 65,800 tonnes on Thursday.
Market players widely believe the material is continuing a recent trend of heading for China. But worries linger that demand support from China may ease, and copper prices may come under pressure as markets approach a traditionally quiet season.
"Medium term, seasonally we're heading into a weaker demand period so you would expect prices to come back a little before an expected recovery before the end of the year," Standard Bank analyst Leon Westgate said.
Aluminum, used in transport and packaging, closed at $1,446 a tonne in LME rings from $1,457. Stocks of aluminum at LME warehouses continued rising, climbing 9,625 tonnes to a record above 3.7 million tonnes.
China's aluminum prices are expected to remain weak for the rest of the year as excess supply from resumed production capacity weighs on the physical market. [ID:nSHA325265]
Tin MSN3 ended down $200 at $12,400, while zinc MZN3 fell 3.4 percent to close at $1,372.
