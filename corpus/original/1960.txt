Chairman Hui Ka Yan, who owns 63 percent of Evergrande, said on the Thursday call that the company has 13 billion yuan ($2 billion) of cash on hand, sufficient to cover its operations. "The other side's accusation is absurd, and we are very, very angry," Hui told investors.
Evergrande denies Citron's accusations, and has said it would not revise its forecast for annual sales of 80 billion yuan. The company said it is organizing a team of lawyers to defend itself against the accusations.
A spokeswoman for Evergrande said the company will issue a formal response to Citron's report via later on Friday.
