* Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR rose 5/32 in price to yield 3.772 percent, down about 2 basis points from late U.S. trade on Friday and retreating from eight-month highs around 4 percent touched twice last week.
* Two-year notes US2YT=RR rose 2/32 in price to yield 1.249 percent, down about 3 basis points.
