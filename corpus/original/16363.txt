) on Wednesday said it cut prices to steelmakers in Korea and Japan, following a similar price cut by Australian rival Rio Tinto (
The move, which responds to a slowing global demand for iron ore, gives Vale a strong position in upcoming talks with Chinese steel mills that are seeking even larger price reductions.
The following are details of Vale's price arrangement with Korea's POSCO (

* IRON ORE FINES: Vale reduced fines prices 28.2 percent from 2008 levels, taking the new reference price per dry tonne Fe unit to $0.85 for Southeastern System fines (SSF), $0.90 for Carajas sinter feed (SFCJ).
Brazil's iron ore is generally considered higher quality than Australian ore and tends to receive a premium.
Analysts say fines are a key part of Vale's production portfolio. Chinese steel makers rely heavily on fines.
* IRON ORE LUMPS: The company cut lumps prices by 44.5 percent from last year's price for a new price of $0.99 for Southeastern System lump and $1.01 for Southern System lump.
Analysts say Vale, as well as Rio, rewarded Japan and Korea for honoring commitments they made last year to buy iron lumps by giving them a considerably larger cut than for the fines heavily used by China.
Analysts said the large cut in pellets price was not surprising because the product, which has more specific uses and is less fungible, has been among the hardest to sell amid slowing demand for ore.
With lower prices, Vale could boost production from pellet plants that were slowed or idled due to the limited demand.
Vale in May said pellets accounted for 8.1 percent of its gross first-quarter revenues, compared to 38.7 for different types of iron ore.
