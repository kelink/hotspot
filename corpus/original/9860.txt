METALS-Copper gains on weak dollar, China imports
2009-10-14 00:37:00.0
(Reuters) - Copper rose on Wednesday, spurred by a weak dollar and data showing Chinese imports of the metal jumped unexpectedly in September.
Copper for three-months delivery MCU3 on the London Metal Exchange closed at $6,220 a tonne from a close of $6,140 on Tuesday and restoring a gap on two-month lows near $5,800 touched at the beginning of October.
Imports of unwrought copper and semi-finished copper products in China rose 23 percent to 399,052 tonnes in September. Analysts had expected 300,000 tonnes because a closed arbitrage window was expected to suppress demand. [ID:nSP540802]
"Much better than expected on the Chinese copper imports," Citigroup analyst David Thurtell said. "Very strong, bullish -- I was expecting further falls.
"For imports to be rising at a time when these purchases were almost certainly made when copper was above $5,000 ... that speaks volumes for me about the strength of Chinese demand."

Buying by China, the world's top copper consumer, has helped the metal used in power and construction double in value in 2009. But analysts have fretted that Chinese support has been waning after the government halted its strategic stockpiling campaign.

"The dollar seems to be pushing all commodity markets," VTB Capital analyst Andrey Kryuchenkov said of Wednesday's gains in base metals.
But a rise in copper stocks at LME warehouses kept demand concerns alive. Continuing an upward trend that started in mid-July, inventories climbed 5,275 tonnes to 353,225 tonnes, their highest level since mid-May. <LME/STX1>
At the LME's annual week-long gathering, some analysts were optimistic about global economic and demand recovery, while producers and consumers remained cautious about 2010 prospects. [ID:nLD687333]
"It's been one of the quieter LME weeks I've been to," said Citigroups's Thurtell. "There is cautious optimism out there. (But) people are tired, they've had a long, traumatic year."
