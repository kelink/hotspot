(Reuters) - Foreigners began 2012 by buying U.S. Treasuries, Treasury data showed on Thursday, with China resuming purchases and Japan's holdings climbing to a record.
China, the biggest foreign U.S. creditor, increased Treasury holdings by $7.6 billion in January to $1.16 trillion.
Bank of New York Mellon termed China's January's purchases a significant improvement as China was a net seller of Treasuries from August to December, "selling a staggering $102.6 billion in December alone", the bank said.
Japan, the second-largest holder of U.S. Treasuries, increased their holdings to a record $1.079 trillion.
Overall, net long-term capital inflows were $101.05 billion up from the $19.12 billion the prior month.
"China increased its purchase by $8 billion. So what?" said Eric Green, chief of U.S. rates research and strategy at TD Securities in New York. "The downtrend in Chinese buying continues. Their net Treasuries position is still down $33 billion over the past 12 months. They will buy Treasuries but will buy them a slower rate."
Net overall capital inflows into the United States fell to $18.825 billion in January from December's revised inflow of $95.216 billion, not enough to cover the trade deficit for the month.
