(Reuters) - Global airlines were warned on Tuesday of significant falls in traffic due to the outbreak of swine flu, and their shares took another hit on fears that the fallout could be at least as bad as that of the 2003 SARS crisis.
IATA, the Geneva-based international airlines lobby, said concerns over a possible pandemic from the bug that has killed 149 people in Mexico would compound the misery for an industry already facing its worst financial crisis for decades.

Cargo traffic fell 21.4 percent, echoing previous months.

With sentiment so weak, and worsened by the swine flu issue, it's unlikely anyone is going to go rushing to book holidays or corporate travel, which means the second half of this year won't be pretty for most airlines," he said.
IATA, which represents 230 carriers, has said airlines could lose $4.7 billion this year before any impact from swine flu.
But the chief executive of Finland's Finnair (
) -- after unveiling worse-than-expected quarterly losses on Tuesday -- said that IATA was too optimistic, and that airlines could lose more than the $8.5 billion they lost last year.
During the SARS outbreak, which began in China and quickly spread to Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, airline traffic in the region most directly affected halved. Airline stocks responded in kind, with carriers such as Cathay, Japan Airlines 9205.T and Korean (
