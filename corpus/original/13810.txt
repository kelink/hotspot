* Profits surge on forex gains, higher sales
SAO PAULO, July 16
VCP VCP.N, as the company is called, said in a statement net income surged to 533 million reais ($276.45 million) from 135 million reais a year earlier. Net revenue rose nearly 10 percent to 689 million reais on record sales volumes to China in June.
The company said it booked net financial gains of 465 million reais in the second quarter, compared with 110 million reais a year earlier. A 16 percent surge in Brazil's currency, the real BRBY, in the period helped increase foreign exchange revenue that more than made up for interest payments and other financial expenses.
Shares of VCP, which took over rival Aracruz Celulose ARCZ6.SAARA.N in a deal valued at 5.4 billion reais earlier this year, rose 1.8 percent on Friday to close at 23.1 reais.
VCP also said it earned 218 million reais from its stake in Aracruz, which reported a second-quarter profit of 595.5 million reais on Thursday.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure of cash generation known as EBITDA, fell to 158 million reais from 212 million reais in the second quarter of 2008. ($1=1.928 reais)
