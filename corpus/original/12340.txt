"It is now quite clear, given that the article has been taken off the Website, that it was essentially the opinion of the individual writer, and not if you like officially sanctioned," Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said.
He said the report did not bear any great relevance to the detentions of Rio Tinto executive Stern Hu, an Australian, and three other China-based staff of the Anglo-Australian company.
The four were detained a month ago on suspicion of stealing state secrets, but they have yet to be officially charged.
"We're not in a position to discuss the details of his case or any possible charges against him, but we have raised -- both at that particular visit and generally -- the question of legal representation for Stern Hu," Smith said.
"We were very pleased to see that his health and welfare continues to be in good order. We have reported that visit to his employer and his family," Smith said.
Hu is entitled to one visit a month from consular officials. For full coverage of the iron ore probe, click [ID:nSP473911]. (Reporting by James Grubel; Editing by Mark Bendeich)
