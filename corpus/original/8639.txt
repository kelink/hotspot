(Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Monday as stronger-than-expected data on manufacturing and pending home sales spurred broad-based gains following a sell-off at the end of last week.
Manufacturing activity rose to its highest level in 3-1/2 years last month, while pending home sales contracts staged a surprising surge in September, data showed, helping to soothe the recovery jitters that hit the market on Friday. For details, see [ID:nN02437173]
"The data was very much on the better side of expectations," said Nick Kalivas, vice president of financial research & senior equity index analyst at MF Global in Chicago.
"The pending home sales being up 6 percent was pretty shocking ... it appears people looking for bargains on foreclosures is continuing and that's helping clear out the housing market slowly but surely."
Earlier data showed euro-zone factory activity expanded for the first time in 17 months and picked up in Britain and China, suggesting a global economic recovery is under way. [ID:nSP62642].
