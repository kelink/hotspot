(Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday following strong quarterly results from Travelers and Apple, while the dollar and yen climbed against most of their major counterparts as China implemented a clampdown on bank lending.
U.S. Treasury debt prices turned flat as stocks advanced, paring earlier gains from China and President Barack Obama's call for a freeze on federal spending on many domestic programs.
China's central bank ordered banks that need to raise their reserve ratios to implement the change on Tuesday, banking sources said. In recent weeks, China has moved to cool bank lending to curb inflation and forestall asset bubbles.
"Since China has started its banking proposals ... this has generally been seen as a concern," said Justin Urquhart Stewart, director at Seven Investment Management.
The dollar and yen climbed against higher-yielding currencies on speculation China, the world's growth engine, will take further steps to cool its economy, discouraging demand for higher-yielding assets.
World stocks as measured by the MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS fell 0.23 percent with their emerging market component .MSCIEF -- a sector particularly sensitive to China -- down 2 percent. Emerging stocks, last year's star performer with a nearly 75 percent gain, have lost more than five percent so far this year.
Adding to China worries, Standard & Poor's cut its outlook on Japan. The rating agency threatened to cut Japan's credit rating unless it produced a credible plan to rein in soaring debt and lift growth in an economy plagued by persistent deflation.
Japan's Nikkei closed down 1.8 percent. That was before S&P cut its outlook.
