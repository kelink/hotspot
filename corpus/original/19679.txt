JFE 08/09 profit down 20 pct, gives no forecast
TOKYO, April 24
Fri  EDT
TOKYO, April 24
), the world's third-biggest steel maker, suffered a 20.4 percent fall in profit for the year that ended in March, hit by a double whammy of crumbling global steel demand and a firm yen that hurt exports.
JFE did not provide a group-based profit forecast for the year to March 2010, saying the new term contract agreements on the price of iron ore, a key raw material used in steelmaking, are yet to be set, making it difficult to forecast its profits.
The No.2 steelmaker in Japan, which competes with Nippon Steel Corp (
), South Korea's POSCO (
) and China's Baosteel (
), said pretax recurring profit in the year ended March 31 was 400.6 billion yen ($4.1 billion) compared with 503 billion yen in the previous year.
Japanese steelmakers are expected to see steep profit falls in the year ahead because steel prices agreed with automakers will be revised down for the first time since April 2008 and as a strong yen squeezes exports. (Reporting by Yuko Inoue; Editing by Dhara Ranasinghe)
