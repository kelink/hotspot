(Reuters) - U.S. investment dealer Raymond James said on Friday it added a new senior director to its Canadian mergers team, the latest sign banks are anticipating a pick-up in the space as the global recession ebbs.
Raymond James Ltd., the Canadian arm of North American investment dealer Raymond James Financial Inc., appointed industry veteran Jeremy Rakusin as managing director and head of mergers and acquisitions for Canada.
"His focus will be to leverage the unique domestic and cross border mergers and acquisitions expertise of Raymond James and deepen relationships with Canadian corporate clients," said President and Chief Executive Paul Allison.
Canadian capital markets have begun to thaw after an extended dry spell, and banks are jockeying for position to capitalize on new activity.
Rakusin will take up the post at Raymond James, which targets middle-market mergers and acquisitions, with a focus on resource firms, in September.
Rakusin comes to the bank most recently from Trapeze Capital. Before that he was director of global markets and investment banking, mergers and acquisitions at Merrill Lynch Canada.
Canada's mergers and acquisitions activity has shown signs of life of late.
In June, China's largest oil refiner Sinopec said it would buy Toronto-listed Swiss oil explorer Addax Petroleum Corp AXC.TO for $7.24 billion in China's biggest overseas acquisition.
The Addax deal may be the tip of the iceberg as Beijing snaps up reserves to secure energy supplies to fuel its growing economy. ($1=$1.08 Canadian) (Reporting by Pav Jordan; editing by Janet Guttsman)
