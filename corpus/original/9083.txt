), Japan's No.2 earth-moving equipment maker, returned to profit in July-September and said a recovery in demand was underway, though it kept its full-year earnings outlook unchanged.
Hitachi Construction, a unit of electronics maker Hitachi Ltd (
), said there were signs of a nascent recovery in the Asia-Pacific, U.S. and other regions, after the global market for excavators, dump trucks and wheel loaders shrank 40 percent in April-September from a year earlier due to the economic downturn.
"In the U.S., for instance, there is a slight pick-up in demand for mini shovels thanks to an improvement in housing starts figures," Senior Vice President Nobuhiko Kuwahara told a news conference.
"And we expect a substantial increase in demand in China in January-March," he said.
Hitachi Construction reported on Tuesday a 3.3 billion yen ($36 million) operating profit for July-September, helped by cost-cutting and lower input costs.
But Hitachi Construction kept its operating profit forecast for the year to March 2010 at 24 billion yen, down 50.9 percent, saying uncertainties remain and recovery signs are still fragile. [ID:nT276S7MJ1]
The world's top maker Caterpillar Inc (
) last week raised its full-year profit forecast, hailing what it said were growing signs of a global economic rebound and sending its shares up more than 4 percent. [ID:nN163583657]
Kuwahara said he expects the company's production will return to a level before the collapse of Lehman Brothers shook the global economy last year in November after bringing its inventories down to about 5,000 units by the end of September.
In the April-September first-half, the global market for construction machinery shrank in every region except China, which grew 18 percent from a year earlier, Hitachi Construction said.
