) are set to rise as the industry shifts from console sales to online subscriptions for downloading games and other high-margin content, according to Barron's.
Activision Blizzard is already at the forefront of the fastest growing sector in the industry -- the music category -- with its "Guitar Hero" blockbuster, the newspaper said in its Aug. 31 edition.
The Santa Monica, California-based company, the first Western gaming company to gain a major presence in China, also dominates the world of online games, with hits including "Starcraft" and "World of Warcraft," according to Barron's.
BMO Capital Markets' game analyst Ed Williams sees Activision shares climbing to $15, up 29 percent from their current levels, the newspaper said.
The company, formed last July through the merger of Activision with Blizzard, the former games unit of France's Vivendi SA (
), is also attractive from a financial perspective, Barron's said, noting it has no debt and about $3 billion in cash.
While franchises such as "Guitar Hero" helped the company weather the global recession better than some rivals, Chief Executive Bobby Kotick told Barron's in an interview that the global downturn and high unemployment is a concern for the business.
Shares in the company closed at $11.69 on Friday. (Reporting by Elinor Comlay, editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
