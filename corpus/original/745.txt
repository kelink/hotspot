(Reuters) - China unveiled a government restructuring plan on Sunday, cutting the number of cabinet-level entities by two in the biggest reduction in ministries since 1998.
* The National Family Planning Commission - the agency that controls the controversial one-child policy - will merge with the Ministry of Health. Some experts have said that would starve the commission of the political support needed to maintain the one-child policy, but the government said family planning must continue "on the basis of stable and low birth rates".
* The plan aims to boost food and drug safety by bundling the responsibilities of several agencies into a ministerial-level General Administration of Food and Drug. The new administration takes over the duties of the State Council's Food Safety Office, the State Food and Drug Administration, the food supervision branch of the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce.
* Two media watchdogs, the General Administration of Press and Publication and the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, will be merged.
* The National Oceanic Administration will be reorganized under the Ministry of Land and Resources and consolidate management over maritime enforcement efforts now carried out by several agencies, including customs, coastguard forces within the Public Security Ministry, and fisheries enforcement carried out by the Agriculture Ministry.
* The State Electricity Regulatory Commission will be dissolved and its responsibilities taken over by a reorganized National Energy Administration, which will remain under the state planner National Development and Reform Commission.
* People's Bank of China
