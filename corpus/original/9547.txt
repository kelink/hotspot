Detroit faces siege by Hollywood movie

(Reuters) - Detroit, which has long faced economic collapse and neighborhood abandonment, woke up on Monday to find itself under siege by a foreign army.
The army arrived with camera booms, military trucks, massive pennants and green camouflage extras for a remake of the 1984 action film "Red Dawn," turning a normally lightly populated Motown intersection into a hub of activity.
Several blocks of downtown Detroit will be closed off for up to two weeks during the filming, which appeared to have little impact on traffic flow, but drew curiosity seekers on foot.
The Michigan statewide unemployment rate stood at 15.2 percent in August, with Detroit's nearly double that.
"It is rough out here," said Edwin Codwell, who stood nearby watching the filming. "It is tough out here for all of us and it is getting worse."
In the new movie, the soldiers are from Russia and China, and Detroit serves as a kind of anytown USA stand-in for Spokane, Washington, and other places.
On Monday, passersby snapped cellphone pictures of military trucks and actors wearing green fatigues or officers uniforms reminiscent of past decades.
Paul Thomas, a student cycling to medical school, stopped to take a photo from the seat of his mountain bike. The street closings made his ride easier, he said. "They should shut it down more often."
