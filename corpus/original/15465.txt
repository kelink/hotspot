Take-Two in deal to make, distribute games in China
NEW YORK, June 23
Tue  EDT
NEW YORK, June 23
) said on Tuesday it has set a deal with China's Tencent Holdings Ltd (
) to develop and distribute online versions of Take-Two's popular NBA 2K basketball video game.
Online gaming on China grew 61 percent to $2.75 billion in 2008, and is expected to rise to $8.9 billion by 2013, the companies said, citing independent research.
Interest in U.S.-based professional basketball has grown in China, spurred in part by the success of players such as Yao Ming of the Houston Rockets, and Yi Jianlian of the New Jersey Nets.
Development of the new games has begun but no release date has been disclosed, Take-Two said. Tencent Holdings, which runs China's largest instant messaging service, has previously said it plans to launch three or four new online games by the end of 2009, as it diversifies away from its core IM service into China's fast-growing online game market.
"China's online games market is at a nascent stage and we believe that the opportunities are just beginning to unfold," Tencent President Martin Lau said in a statement.
