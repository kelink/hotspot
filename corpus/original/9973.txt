) to some 41,000 union-represented Ford workers for a ratification vote.
Ford, the only U.S. automaker to have avoided bankruptcy, had said that concessions granted to General Motors Co [GM.UL] and Chrysler would have put it at a disadvantage under restructuring deals for its rivals brokered by the Obama administration.
The following are highlights from the proposed agreement, which would amend the four-year contract reached in 2007 between the union and Ford.
* UAW-represented workers at Ford would get a $1,000 bonus paid in March 2010.
* Entry-level workers, who would start at $14 per hour, would have their wages frozen for the duration of the agreement.
* There would be no cap on the number of such entry level workers Ford could hire until 2015, when entry-level workers would be capped at 20 percent of the factory work force. That would force Ford to grant traditional employee wages by seniority to new hires after that date.
* Skilled trade job classifications would be simplified and workers would be placed in "mechanical teams" handling a range of assignments in the plants. That plan would be implemented in all Ford's U.S. factories by June 2011.
* Ford made a number of production commitments to the UAW intended to preserve union jobs. These included a renewed commitment by Ford to bring new products to assembly plants in Ohio, Kansas, Michigan, Kentucky and Illinois.
* New production commitments by Ford include bringing a new vehicle to Ford's Michigan Assembly Plant, building hybrid battery packs at a plant in in Rawsonville, Michigan and bringing a new vehicle to the Louisville Assembly plant that Ford could also export for sale to other markets.
