(Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries were steady in Asian trade on Friday, with the benchmark 10-year bond yield below 3 percent as falls in U.S. stock futures and regional shares lent some support.
* The market showed muted reaction to news that China's gold reserves had risen 454 tonnes since 2003 and were now the fifth largest in the world, which lifted spot gold XAU=. [ID:nPEK306598]
* On Thursday, the Federal Reserve's purchase of $7 billion of Treasuries stemmed an early sell-off and prevented 10-year yields from touching 3 percent. A rise to 3 percent for the 10-year yield would have been the first since the Fed announced it was intervening back in March.
* "The accompanying decline in vol strengthens our view that 10-year rates will continue to trade rangebound until the FOMC meeting next week, and the results of bank stress tests in early May," said analysts at Barclays Capitals in a note to clients.
* The 10-year notes edged up 3/32 in price to yield 2.921 percent US10YT=RR, down about 1 basis point from late New York trade.
* The two-year notes were unchanged in price to yield 0.937 percent US2YT=RR, while the 30-year bonds were little changed in price to yield 3.792 percent US30YT=RR.
* U.S. stock futures slid 0.7 percent SPc1, while Tokyo's Nikkei share average dropped 1.2 percent .N225.
* Investors awaited the results of stress tests of top U.S. banks due to be unveiled on May 4, after U.S. bank regulators release a report on Friday detailing the assumptions of their tests.
* U.S. Treasury Timothy Geithner is scheduled to hold a press conference at 2030 GMT, following a Group of Seven meeting of finance officials.
* Friday's data includes durable goods orders, which halted their slide in February with a solid 3.5 percent bounce. The March figures are expected to show some deterioration with a 1.5 percent decline.
* Existing home sales for March proved considerably weaker than expected, and a similar outcome for March new home sales due later in the day would be seen helping push bond yields down. [ECI/US] (Editing by Chris Gallagher)
