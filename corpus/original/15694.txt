(Reuters) - Steel mills in the northern Chinese province of Shanxi have reportedly signed iron ore supply deals with foreign miners despite calls to hold firm until annual contract prices have been settled.
The China Times newspaper said the Shanxi mills had achieved a better price than Japanese and South Korean steel companies, which agreed a 33 percent price cut with Australian miners earlier this month.
Officially, China is still refusing to budge in its attempt to secure a 40 percent cut from the big three suppliers -- BHP Billiton (
) of Australia and Brazil's Vale (
) -- but with less than two weeks to go before negotiations end, individual steel mills have been seeking their own agreements.
Citing Zhu Fengliang, secretary general of the Shanxi Iron and Steel Association, the Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper reported on Friday that a number of steel enterprises in the province had already jointly negotiated supply deals with overseas miners.
The China Iron and Steel Association has said previously the validity of contracts would not be recognised, adding that it could revoke the import licences of any enterprise that undermined China's negotiating position.
However, traders have suggested the association was likely to turn a blind eye to individual steel mills signing independent long-term contracts with foreign miners should the annual negotiations end without reaching a final settlement.
Rising steel output to near record highs and strong imports of iron ore are are undermining Chinese efforts to win a deeper price cut. (Reporting by Beijing newsroom; Additional reporting by Miyoung Kim in SEOUL; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
