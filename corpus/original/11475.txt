Boxing-Hall of Fame trainer Duva to work with China's Zhang

(Reuters) - China's super-heavyweight Olympic silver medallist Zhang Zhilei is working with Hall of Fame trainer Lou Duva as part of his preparations for the 2012 Games, according to Chinese state media.
The 26-year-old amateur, a bronze medallist at the 2007 world championships, is already in the U.S. working with Duva, who has handled more than a dozen world champions including heavyweight Evander Holyfield.
"My dream is to win the title at the London Olympics," the 6ft 7in (2.01m) Zhang, who lost to Italian Roberto Cammarelle in the final in Beijing last year, told Xinhua news agency.
China has little pedigree in boxing, where home-grown martial arts are far more popular.
Light-flyweight Zou Shiming, however, won the country's first Olympic medal -- a bronze -- in the ring in Athens in 2004 and was one of two gold medallists on home soil at the Beijing Games.
Promoters D & D Global, run by Duva's son Dino and Richard Davimos, said the work with Zhang was just the start of a deal which will see more of China's top prospects being trained in the U.S.
"It's an honour that the Chinese Boxing Federation has entrusted me with its premiere boxers in this training cooperation programme," Duva, 87, told www.fightnews.com.
