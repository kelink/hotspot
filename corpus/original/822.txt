Wall Street advances as data outweighs budget cuts

(Reuters) - Stocks advanced modestly on Friday, leaving the S&P 500 with slight gains in a volatile week as strong economic data overshadowed growth concerns in China and Europe and let investors discount the impact of expected government spending cuts.
Stocks opened sharply lower for the session as Asian factories slowed and European output fell, but most of the losses evaporated after a report showed manufacturing activity expanded last month at its fastest clip in 20 months.
With $85 billion in government budget cuts set to begin, President Barack Obama blamed Republicans for failure to reach a compromise to avert the cuts, known as sequester. But the stock market appeared to have already priced in the failure by legislators to reach an agreement.
"We were able to dig out of that hole, but not make any great strides on it either," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. "We will probably be in a holding pattern pending some big development on a broader budget deal."

added 3.52 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,518.20. The Nasdaq Composite Index
advanced 9.55 points, or 0.30 percent, to 3,169.74.
For the week, the Dow rose 0.6 percent, the S&P 500 edged up 0.2 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.3 percent.
The slight gains for equities came during a volatile week that saw markets decline on Monday after uncertain Italian elections, only to rebound in the next two sessions as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke defended the central bank's stimulus measures.
The low interest rates due to the Federal Reserve's accommodative monetary policy have helped equities continue to attract investors. The Dow is less than 1 percent away from its all-time intraday high of 14,198.10. Declines have been shallow and short-lived, with investors jumping in to buy on dips.

Is this story from today? I¡¯ve been looking all over and don¡¯t find any article that points to strong U.S. data. Additionally the market has been mostly hovering down today.

You need a copy editor. ¡°Wall Street edges up as data outweighs sequester¡± is wrong as data is plural and outweighs is singular. PLEASE!

Wall Street wealth is the reason we are having budget cuts and the reason our economy is floundering. Wall Street has insulated itself from our economy, because those finance geeks get rich whether or not the economy is flourishing or tanking. Therefore, it is no surprise that Wall Street takes no notice of the federal budget cuts, which only affect middle class federal employees. Hedge funds simply adjust their derivatives to take advantage elsewhere. Wall Street is a leech on our economy as they extract all the wealth and do not give their fair share back. Ask any Goldman or Smith-Barney shark and they¡¯ll all sheepishly admit that everyone on their floor is doing shady deals and cheating their customers. We need to get rid of corpporate tax breaks and tax all those people who are nothing but an inefficiency in our economy.
