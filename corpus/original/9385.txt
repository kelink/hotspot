(Reuters) - French electrical equipment maker Schneider Electric (
Shares were down 2.5 percent at 0802 GMT, compared with a drop of about 1.3 percent for the CAC 40 index of France's biggest companies.
Third-quarter sales were 3.95 billion euros ($5.9 billion). They were forecast at 3.97 billion, according to a poll of six analysts by Reuters.
Schneider markets equipment for low and medium-tension electricity systems, and energy savings products for commercial and residential buildings. These activities make it sensitive to changes in the economic cycle because construction and infrastructure projects tend to slow during a recession.

Sales in Europe dropped 22.3 percent to 1.52 billion euros on an organic basis, while North America dropped 21.3 percent to 1.10 billion.
"There are clear signs on stabilization in mature countries, but the end market demand remains soft overall," said Chief Executive Jean-Pascal Tricoire on a conference call with analysts.
Asia fared a bit better, with sales dropping 5.3 percent to 891 million euros. China was the main engine there as its government spent heavily on stimulus projects including rail, power and local transport systems, said the company in a conference call with analysts.
"New economies demonstrate again their structurally superior growth potential," said Tricoire. Such emerging markets account for one-third of Schneider's sales, he added. ($1=0.6697 euros) (Reporting by Leila Abboud; Editing by Dan Lalor and Mike Nesbit)
