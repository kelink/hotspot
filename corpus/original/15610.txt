(Reuters) - China closed a primary school in the southern province of Guangdong on Sunday after 30 pupils were diagnosed with the H1N1 strain of flu, the Xinhua news agency said on Sunday.
Guangdong province has 111 confirmed H1N1 cases, the most of any region of China.
Six students at the Shipai Township Central Primary School fell ill on Wednesday, followed by another 24 on Thursday and Friday, Xinhua said.
None had left the city of Dongguan for 10 days before they came down with the flu, and there had not previously been any known cases in the area, Xinhua said.
China last week released rules for restricting movement, prohibiting large gatherings and shutting schools should a cluster of the H1N1 strain appear in residential neighborhoods.
It had earlier maintained strict quarantine of incoming passengers who might have been exposed to the virus, to try to prevent it from slipping into the broader population.
China has confirmed about 400 cases of H1N1, but experts worry the disease may turn into something more lethal if it spreads freely in the huge Chinese population.
In neighboring Hong Kong, primary schools closed early for the summer and some secondary schools have also been shut, to try to prevent the virus from spreading more rapidly.
