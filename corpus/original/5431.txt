(Reuters) - The foreign ministers of China, Russia and India urged Iran on Monday to prove to the world that its nuclear ambitions are peaceful, and urged a return to talks.
"The three foreign ministers recognize Iran's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy," they said in a joint statement released on the Chinese foreign ministry's website (www.mfa.gov.cn) after a meeting in China's Wuhan city.
"At the same time, Iran should restore the faith of the international community of the totally peaceful nature of its nuclear activities," they added.
"The only path to resolving the Iran nuclear issue is through dialogue, negotiations and other such peaceful methods."
European Union foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton wrote to Iran's chief nuclear negotiator on Friday accepting an offer to meet in Europe early next month to discuss Tehran's nuclear program.
Following consultations with the six world powers which she will represent -- the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany -- Ashton wrote to Saeed Jalili accepting the offer of a meeting on December 5, but suggested Switzerland or Austria as the venue.
