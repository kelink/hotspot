(Reuters) - Tsingtao Brewery (
), China's best known beer brand, said on Thursday its net profit jumped 93 percent in the third quarter, as barley costs remained soft and the country's beer consumption continued to recover.
Analysts had been expecting Tsingtao, which competes with Heineken (
), Carlsberg (
), Kingway Brewery (
), and Snow Beer brands, to post strong growth in earnings due to the lower price for barley.
The Chinese brewer had earlier this month forecast a 75 to 85 percent increase in January-September profit from a year earlier as it boosted domestic sales, improved brand integration and product mix and lowered its costs. [ID:nHKG309139]
Analysts are generally positive on Chinese brewers including Tsingtao due to a faster-than-expected recovery in China's beer market. They said Tsingtao's volume growth was basically in-line with the market.
Tsingtao, the second largest brewer in China by volume, said its net profit rose to 615.18 million yuan ($90.09 million) for the three months through September, from 318.69 million yuan a year earlier.
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S expect on average for Tsingtao's profit for 2009 to rise about 60 percent to 1.11 billion yuan.
Shares in Tsingtao rose 19 percent in the third quarter, outperforming a 14 percent rise in the benchmark Hang Seng Index
during the 3-month period. (US$1=HK$7.75=6.827 yuan) (Reporting by Donny Kwok; editing by Doug Young and Karen Foster)
