(Reuters) - A unit of India's state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp (
) is close to completing renegotiation of an oil deal in Iraq signed under Saddam Hussein, company sources said on Monday.
"The deal will be done shortly," the source at ONGC's overseas investment arm ONGC Videsh (OVL) told Reuters. "We have had three or four meetings and have more lined up."
The exploration deal would be for Block Number 8 in Iraq's western desert. The deal was first signed in 2000.
A team of Iraqi officials visited India in April to discuss the terms of the deal, another source said.
"Discussions with them were very positive on negotiation of new terms and conditions," he said. "Once these are settled, we are ready to sign the contract and begin from where we have left off."
Russia has pressed Baghdad to revive another Saddam-era deal, a $3.7 billion agreement oil group LUKOIL (
) signed to develop Iraq's West Qurna oilfield struck in 1996. Saddam's government tore up the deal in 2002, saying the Russian company had done no work at the field.
Baghdad has to date declined to restore that deal, although Russia's energy minister said last month the two sides had agreed to work on it.
