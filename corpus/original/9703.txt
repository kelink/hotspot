Over the past few weeks, the 36-year-old has been putting in the hours to perfect his foxtrot and salsa routines but that meant he was out slightly out of sync while performing his day job.
Jovtchev, a twice former world champion, missed out on the rings gold medal by 0.1 point, eclipsed by the single mindedness of China's Yan Mingyong.
"I've been practicing two times a week for like 20 minutes. I have no time because I have other things to do as I'm doing Dancing with the Stars," the five-times Olympian said after picking up his eighth world medal on the rings.
"It's too much other stuff and not much time to practice as I'm tired doing other things."
Despite his lack of commitment to the sport in which he won his first world medal eight years ago in Ghent, Jovtchev showed that he still had the strength and the belief to outclass much younger rivals in the strongman's event.
"I'm more than satisfied because when I got here I wasn't really ready for the competition, I was maybe 60 percent," he said.
"At least I made an okay routine and nice and clean as it wasn't the most difficult that I can do."
"Even I'm surprised sometimes that I can make things that are good enough to get a medal, especially for this competition."
Although Jovtchev had planned to retire after the 2008 Beijing Games, he is now having too much fun and has no idea how long he can go on for.
"The pressure I have in a competition is something I would miss if I quit right now. I don't know when I'm going to quit," he said.
