"I think emerging markets continue to offer the best opportunities. That is where the economic activity is best right now," Cargill CFO David MacLennan told Reuters in an interview after the company announced quarterly earnings.
"Developed economies like the U.S. and Western Europe are still very much in the recovery phase, but if you look at economies like Brazil, China, India, Southeast Asian economies, where we've been growing and investing a lot in recent years, things look pretty good by comparison."
Cargill -- a leading U.S. grain exporter, major ethanol producer and top energy trader that operates in 68 countries -- said Tuesday quarterly profits fell 69 percent compared with a year earlier as a weak economy hurt by a loss in its risk management and financial services sector.
Disappointing earnings in Cargill's industrial segment, which includes its majority investment in fertilizer producer Mosaic Co (
), also contributed to lower fourth-quarter profits.
"The worst is behind us," citing weak demand coming into the U.S. planting season.
Full-year earnings decreased 16 percent to $3.33 billion, from a record $3.95 billion in the prior year -- making it Cargill's second-best year in history.
"Our view is, keep markets clear and unfettered and don't put up trade barriers," MacLennan said. "In terms of global climate change, we're a supporter of doing the right things as a company and we joined the Chicago Climate Exchange for example. So we are watching it carefully."
