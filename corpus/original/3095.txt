China's IPO market the world's biggest despite slump

(Reuters) - China remained the world's biggest IPO market in 2011, even as total funds raised slumped from the previous year due to global economic uncertainty, undercoring the shift of financial power from the west to the east.
Chinese firms raised a combined 286.1 billion yuan ($45.5 billion) through initial public offerings in Shanghai and Shenzhen last year, 41 percent less than in 2010, accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) said. Still, China outshines the United States and Hong Kong in terms of IPO fundraising.
PwC forecast that China's IPO market would remain at the same level in 2012, raising 270-300 billion yuan, even as the market faces headwinds including weak investor demand and price volatility.
"Many Chinese companies are preparing for IPOs and waiting for the right time to go public," Frank Lyn, PwC China Markets Leader, told a press briefing.
"IPOs in Shenzhen ... will remain active in 2012," he said, adding that the IPO market will be driven by sectors including industrial products, retail, consumer goods and services, as well as financial service.
China's IPO market, which saw a total of 282 new listings in 2011, had cooled from the previous year due to a sluggish stock market that slumped 22 percent amid growing economic uncertainty and the lingering euro zone debt crisis.
"It is rational that the IPO market cools down after a blowout in 2010," said Jean Sun, a partner at PwC China.
Still, China's IPO market last year, worth 286 billion yuan, was the biggest in the world. Hong Kong's IPO market raised 220.7 billion yuan during the same period, while the U.S. market was worth 224.3 billion yuan, PwC said.
China also had the world's biggest IPO market in 2010, when the number of Chinese IPOs more than tripled from the previous year to 349, while the amount of IPO funds raised more than doubled to 488.3 billion yuan.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
It is not surprising that China leads in IPO¡¯s because the government at all levels encourages small business lending that allows some small firms to become successful companies, some of which will need IPO¡¯s to continue to grow. The 12th and 13th Five Year Plans (2011-2020) seek development of central and western provinces with infrastructure that include spaces for factories, shops, shopping centers, and residences for workers with paychecks who will also be customers and taxpayers. The IPO¡¯s will help expand more businesses for more profits that make additional growth and taxes that let the government start the small business loans for new entrepreneurs that keep the process going. In addition, China throws in infrastructure projects for trading partners to improve their economies because China trades more with rich nations than with poor countries, so China makes new customers in its trading partners for future sales. This policy helps China maintain high trade surplusses, so some IPO¡¯s will be needed to finance companies engaged in trade.
