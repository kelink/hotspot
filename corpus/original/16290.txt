UPDATE 1-HSBC: No timetable for raising stake in China's BoCom
Thu  EDT
BEIJING, June 11
), Europe's biggest bank, has no timetable for increasing its stake in China's Bank of Communications (
), a senior HSBC executive said on Friday.
) owns about 19 percent of China's fifth-biggest lender and has previously said it would be interested in raising that to the 20 percent ceiling imposed by the Chinese government on foreign stakes in domestic banks.
Vincent Cheng, HSBC executive director and chairman for Asia-Pacific, also told reporters the UK-based bank had no plans to reduce its stake in BoCom (
), the latest in a series of Western banks, including Bank of America (
), to cut their Chinese bank stakes in order to raise capital.
BoCom, for its part, is eyeing expansion of its branch network overseas, Peng Chun, deputy head of the bank told reporters.
Peng said BoCom, which has branches in Singapore, New York and Tokyo, was looking at San Francisco, Sydney and Ho Chi Minh City.
He added that the strengthening Chinese economy meant borrowers would have little trouble repaying debt this year, limiting any potential rise in non-performing loans.
"Maintaining economic growth equals protecting banks," Peng told the forum.
