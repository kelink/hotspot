(Reuters) - China's Zhejiang Geely Holdings is aiming to buy Ford's (
) Volvo unit by May for up to $2 billion, and turn the money-losing brand around by adding major production in China, a knowledgeable source said on Tuesday.
As part of its plan to bring loss-making Volvo to profit, Zhejiang Geely, parent of Hong Kong-listed Geely Automobile (
), plans to produce 300,000 Volvo brand cars per year in its Beijing factory, according to the source, who had seen a document submitted to regulators by Geely.
The deal would see Geely acquire Volvo for $1.5 billion to $2 billion, with an expected closing date in May after the signing of the initial agreement next month, according to a copy of the Geely document seen by Reuters.
Under the deal, Geely will keep the brand and operations in Sweden, including Volvo's headquarters, production facility and research center, intact after the acquisition.
"(Geely) will keep the core value of Volvo as a luxury brand unchanged, while improving it with the development in emerging markets, and add more fashionable, dynamic and passionate international elements," said the document.
Volvo is expected to post earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of $703 million in 2015, the document said.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Good try, however Geely is too young to handle Volvo.
