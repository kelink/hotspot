Conexant's broadband access product line is expected to strengthen Ikanos' market position in North America and China. Ikanos develops chips and software products that enable network equipment makers and service providers to provide broadband.
The acquisition will allow Ikanos to double its revenue and add to its earnings within the first year after the deal closes, Ikanos said in a statement.
The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter, it said.
In connection with the transaction, Tallwood Venture Capital, an investment firm focused on the semiconductor industry, agreed to buy 24 million of Ikanos common shares for $42 million, or $1.75 a share.
Upon completion of the transactions, Tallwood Venture Capital will own about 45 percent of the outstanding shares of Ikanos, excluding the warrants.
For Conexant, the sale represents a step in its efforts to restructure operations. Conexant will henceforth focus exclusively on providing services for imaging, audio, video and various embedded-modem applications.
About 400 Conexant employees at locations in the United States, India and China will join Ikanos when the transaction closes.
Conexant shares were trading up 9 percent at $1.39, while Ikanos was up 4 percent at $1.52 in morning trade Wednesday on Nasdaq. (Reporting by S. John Tilak in Bangalore; Editing by Vinu Pilakkott)
