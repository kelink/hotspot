Oct 5 (Reuters) - South Korean authorities have seized cargo containers belonging to North Korea under U.N. sanctions imposed on the reclusive state for past weapons tests, a news report said on Monday while China's premier continues a visit to Pyongyang.
Indian warships have detained a North Korean cargo ship for dropping anchor in Indian waters without permission, a navy spokesman said, adding the vessel was empty and nothing incriminating had been found in a preliminary investigation.
Following are some international sanctions that remain in place in connection with North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile activities and suspected human rights violations.
* U.N. Security Council resolution 1874 of June 2009 allows inspection of all cargo to and from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or DPRK, along with vessels containing suspicious cargo. The resolution also bans provision of fuel or supplies, or services for North Korean vessels suspected to be carrying banned items. Suspicious vessels are also subject to inspection on the high seas.
* Security Council resolution 1695 of July 2006, also after the launch of Taepodong-2, bans trading of material, technology and financial resources that could be used in any programme of weapons of mass destruction in the North.
* Japan bans imports of North Korean goods and prohibits port calls by North Korean vessels. As part of the Security Council ban on trading in luxury goods, Japan prohibits the sale of beef, caviar and fatty tuna, along with expensive cars, motorcycles and cameras.
* Movement of goods and equipment from South Korea, with which the North has a sizeable trading relationship, is limited under a 1996 multinational arrangement that controls the transfer of dual-use goods that could be used for military purposes.
* In return for progress North Korea made in nuclear disarmament, the United States said in October last year it had removed the North from a terrorism blacklist and from the terms of its Trading with the Enemy Act, ending some trade sanctions.
* Five North Korean organisations, including its General Bureau of Atomic Energy, which oversees its main nuclear complex, and trading firms were blacklisted in July by a U.N. sanctions committee under resolution 1874. Four individuals have been blacklisted. (Source: the United Nations, U.S. State and Treasury Departments, South Korean Foreign Ministry, Reuters) (Reporting by Christine Kim; editing by Jack Kim)
