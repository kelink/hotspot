METALS-Copper steadies; data soothes but jitters remain

(Reuters) - Copper closed off its session highs on Friday after better-than-expected data from the United States failed to produce a strong reaction in a market that continued to correct from overheated levels, analysts said.
"It (copper) got way ahead of itself," Matthew Zeman, head of trading with LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago, said of the red metal's more-than-40-percent price rally since the start of the year.
"Even with the data coming out and tending to be a little bit more on the positive side or better-than-expected, we are not seeing the market reacting quite as strongly."
Copper for July delivery HGN9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division eased 0.95 cent to settle at $2.0175 a lb, after dealing in a session range between $1.9735 and $2.0465.
On the London Metal Exchange, three-month copper MCU3 closed up $5 at $4,450 a tonne, moving between $4,332 and $4,495.25.

Separate reports showing improved national consumer sentiment and a slower rate of contraction in New York state manufacturing in May added to the positive news flow, but market sentiment remained cautious.
"It's waning Chinese demand, the market moving towards a seasonally weak period for demand, and just generally less optimism that a recovery can be sustained," Calyon analyst Robin Bhar said of Friday's cautious market mood.
"I think some of the recovery we have seen here in some of these (commodity) markets has been the reentry of some of the speculative hot-money thinking that commodities have bottomed out and will start to work higher, irrespective of the fundamentals," said Steve Platt, futures analyst with Archer Financial Services in Chicago.
Market players have begun to fret that recent buying by China -- a trend that has helped drive copper's 2009 rally -- was merely the world's biggest copper consumer stockpiling at attractive prices.
Recent rises in canceled warrants -- material earmarked for delivery -- was proof of Chinese stockpiling, analysts said.
But on Thursday canceled warrants fell to 61,300 tonnes, 17 percent of total LME stocks, from 72,525 tonnes a day earlier.
"Strong Chinese buying has been the foundation for this rally," Barclays Capital said in a note. "But we suspect that this process has now largely run its course."
But stocks of copper in LME warehouses fell 12,850 tonnes to 357,800 tonnes to their lowest level since early January.
Aluminum was at $1,522 a tonne from $1,531 on Thursday. Sentiment for the metal was hit by news of a 49,275 tonne jump in LME stocks to 3.93 million. <LME/STX1>
It now looks inevitable that aluminum stocks will reach an unprecedented 4 million tonnes and could even climb to 5.0 million this year, some analysts said. [ID:nLC786254]

Zinc MZN3 was last quoted at $1,495/1,500 a tonne from $1,495, while battery material lead MPB3 closed at $1,482 from $1,430. Tin MSN3 was last quoted at $13,650/13,700 from $13,600.
Supply worries over tin and lead, due to a dominant position controlling between 50 and 80 percent of cash warrants on LME stocks, are expected to bolster prices for nearby delivery, traders said. <LME/WC>
The worry is reflected by the premium for cash material over three months, which was at $274 a tonne, off highs over $700 in late April, but still above levels below $100 in mid-April.
