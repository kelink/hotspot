(Reuters) - French tire manufacturer Michelin (
Michelin slightly exceeded a Reuters Estimate of first-quarter sales of 3.445 billion euros, based on six analysts' forecasts.
Michelin said in a statement it was well on track toward generating positive free cash flow in 2009. Managing partner and finance chief Jean-Dominique Senard, during a conference call with analysts, did not rule out achieving positive free cash flow in the first half.
Michelin said unit sales fell 24.4 percent, as demand dropped in all its markets except China.
It said price increases carried out in 2008 had a positive impact, with an 11 percent price-mix impact. The group would probably see a neutral impact from raw material prices in the first half, Senard told analysts.
"The original market is down sharply ... This could change, by the way, by the end of the year if the big programs that are implemented throughout the world start to kick in," Senard said.
Tire and equipment makers have suffered along with automakers, which have been forced to slash production to cut down on costly inventories of unsold vehicles as the recession has dried up demand for new cars.
Government sales incentives have started to have an impact in the early part of the year, with sales in Germany and France rising in March, as some drivers have taken advantage of cash bonuses for trading in old cars for newer, greener models.
Michelin said it felt a positive currency impact in the first quarter from gains against the euro by the U.S. dollar, and to a lesser extent, the Chinese yuan.
Michelin shares closed down 2.75 percent at 35.66 euros on Tuesday, just before the sales figures were released. France's benchmark CAC-40 index
