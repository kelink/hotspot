(Reuters) - Egypt wants to boost private investment by about 75 percent to 200 billion Egyptian pounds ($36.6 billion) by 2012/13 from the 2008/09 level by attracting Egyptian and foreign investors, a minister said on Wednesday.
Investment Minister Mahmoud Mohieldin told a Reuters Middle East Investment Summit the government plan included promoting 52 mainly infrastructure projects, targeting investors in Egypt, Gulf Arab states, Asia, Europe and the United States.
Egypt's private investment climbed steadily before the financial crisis to 134 billion pounds in the financial year 2007/08 then tumbled to 114 billion pounds in 2008/09. The target for 2009/10 is to reach around 135 billion pounds again.
"We are confident that we are going today to reach the private sector target of 130-135 billion Egyptian pounds, despite the crisis," Mohieldin said.
"We are just hoping that with this kind of pace and momentum we can go close to 200 billion Egyptian pounds by the year 2012," the minister said, referring to the financial year 2012/13.
Boosting the level of private investment, both foreign and Egyptian, is part of the government's efforts to push economic growth back up to more than 7 percent a year -- the level achieved before the crisis. Growth last year was 4.7 percent.
The 52 projects being promoted include roads, ports, renewable energy projects, medical cities and new universities.
Together, the 52 projects would require 120-140 billion pounds of investment, spread over three years starting from July 2009, Mohieldin said.
He said the projects had already seen "very good interest" from Gulf-based firms and institutions from China, Malaysia, South Korea and Singapore, as well as having attracted the attention of "a couple of investment houses based in London."
