(Reuters) - China next week marks one year since the May 12 earthquake that devastated parts of the country's southwest. Here are some facts about the quake and its aftermath.
* The 8.0-magnitude quake had its epicenter in Wenchuan county, Sichuan province. The quake was caused by tectonic faults rupturing and grinding for hundreds of kilometers along the Longmen Mountains.
* More than 80,000 people died, with thousands still officially listed as missing. The worst devastation was in Wenchuan, where nearly 24,000 died or are counted as missing -- about a fifth of its population -- and Beichuan county, where 20,000 of its 160,000 residents died or are missing.
* This was by far China's deadliest quake since the 1976 disaster in Tangshan, east of Beijing, which killed up to 300,000 people.
* Beijing has said it will channel 1 trillion yuan ($147 billion) to rebuilding quake-hit areas, much of it from bank loans and local coffers. Jiang Jufeng, governor of Sichuan province, has said 1.7 trillion yuan is needed for the task.
* China on Thursday said 5,335 schoolchildren died or remained missing from the earthquake, a much lower number than estimates compiled from news reports at the time and projected by some experts and critics.
* Many parents blame shoddy buildings for the deaths, pointing to apartments and government offices that survived while nearby schools fell.
* One survey by engineers from Tsinghua University in Beijing and two other universities assessed 384 buildings across Sichuan. Of 44 school buildings counted, 57 percent (25) were damaged beyond repair. Of 54 government buildings, 13 percent (7) were in that state of damage, as were 25 percent of shops and housing.
