(Reuters) - Taiwan's first fund targeting the Chinese stock market has raised less money than expected on concerns the market may pull back from its recent rally, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday.
"Investors see further downside risk (in Chinese stocks) in the short term. They would rather wait and see," an executive of Polaris International Securities Investment Trust, which is raising the new fund, told Reuters.
The fund, which will track the WISE CSI300 ETF (
) fund, will not be able to meet the T$10 billion ($305 million) cap when it closes fundraising later on Friday, said the source, who asked to remain anonymous due to not being authorised to speak to the media.
Chinese stocks fell 5 percent on Wednesday in heavy turnover, posting their biggest slide in eight months, amid worries that banks may begin to restrict lending. [ID:nHKG282068]
Despite the sell-off, China shares .SZSA1
have shot up more than 85 percent year to date, making them the world's top performers.
The CSI300 ETF, managed by BOCI-Prudential Asset Management, was up 1.3 percent in mid-day trading in Hong Kong, trailing the Hang Seng Index's
1.8 percent gain. (US$ = T$32.8) (Writing by Faith Hung; Editing by Chris Lewis and Jonathan Hopfner)
