(Reuters) - Brazil's Vale, the world's biggest iron ore producer, on Thursday posted a first-quarter net profit of $1.36 billion, down 33 percent from $2.02 billion a year ago, as the global economic crisis cut iron ore demand and prices.
), one of the world's top three miners, said earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- a key measure of cash flow known as EBITDA -- fell to $2.28 billion from $3.7 billion a year earlier under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP).
Analysts had predicted Vale would post a net profit of $1.34 billion and EBITDA of $2.45 billion for the quarter, according to the average forecast of five analysts surveyed by Reuters.
The company cut iron ore output by 10 percent, or about 30 million tonnes, and idled six pellet plants equating to about a third of pellet capacity in response to a sudden drop in demand for iron ore after the global economic crisis erupted.
It also shut down nickel mining operations in Ontario, Canada, for an eight-week period.
The company also announced 1,300 job cuts in December and obliged another 5,500 to take any paid leave they were entitled to between December and March.
Vale said earlier this year that it was on track to export a record amount of iron ore to Asia in the first quarter, after signing on many new steel mills in China to supply contracts. China on Wednesday said it had imported a record 53.5 million tonnes of ore in April.
But overall iron ore output for the company fell 37 percent in the first quarter from a year ago, while its pellets production fell 73 percent, Vale reported in late April.
