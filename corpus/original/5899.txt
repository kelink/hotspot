China to crack down on pro-Cantonese protesters

(Reuters) - Authorities in China's southern city of Guangzhou will punish people who try and organize any more protests in support of the Cantonese dialect, a state-run newspaper said on Friday.
Several hundred people took to Guangzhou's streets on Sunday to demand the government halt efforts to push aside Cantonese.
The protest was prompted by plans to switch most programing on Guangzhou television stations to the country's official language, Mandarin, feeding fears that the government wants to phase out Cantonese in official settings.
Police broke up the peaceful protest, saying it was illegal.
"The city government will continue to spare no effort to promote ... Cantonese opera, and Cantonese pop music in the coming years," he was quoted as saying.
Cantonese is still widely spoken in the booming southern province of Guangdong, thanks in part to the spillover influence of Hong Kong's wildly successful and racy vernacular pop culture, but some people fear for its future.
An influx of outsiders seeking work in China's coastal export hubs has added to the onslaught on local languages.

If ever a movement by Cantonese people to seek indepenence from the monolithic, dictatorial rule of egotistical, power hungry communist domination, I would whole-heartedly support it.
