China tells officials keep unhappy citizens at home

(Reuters) - A Chinese government official on Thursday called on local officials to prevent unhappy members of the public from coming to Beijing to seek redress for problems to ensure stability ahead of October's National Day celebrations.
Police from distant provinces lurk around the petitions offices in the capital, waiting to whisk complainants from their home areas into detention before they can shame local leaders.
Some are taken to "black jails" in Beijing where they may be beaten before being whisked home, but others manage to stage sometimes quite dramatic protests before being dragged off by police.
State-run Xinhua news agency cited Zhou Benshun, head of the Communist Part's Political and Legislative Affairs Committee, as telling a meeting that petitioners' issues should be resolved at the grassroots level if possible.
"Problems can be solved without coming to Beijing," Zhou was quoted as saying.
State petitioning offices have for decades offered a rare official channel for ordinary people to vent complaints, a system that reaches back to ancient times, when subjects could petition the emperor and his officials.
But human rights groups say the stability-obsessed government is cracking down on any kind of dissent this year, which also marks 20 years since the bloody suppression of pro-democracy protests around Tiananmen Square.
