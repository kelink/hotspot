Fri  EDT
Samsung Electronics achieved healthy increases in sales and profits during the third quarter of the financial year thanks to higher demand for its components and finished products, it said Friday. The company also said it expects global demand for its products to improve next year and brought forward some investment originally planned for next year.
Sales in the July to September period were 35.9 trillion won (US$30 billion), up 18 percent on the same period last year, while consolidated operating profit almost tripled to 4.2 trillion won. Samsung didn't announce company-wide net profit figures.
Sales and profitability rose across the board in all of Samsung's four main business sectors.
In the semiconductor division prices for DRAM chips, which are used as main memory in PCs, increased during the quarter on the back of seasonal demand and NAND flash memory prices also increased.
In the telecom Samsung shipped 60.2 million cell phone handsets during the quarter however the average selling price of each handset dropped 3 percent to US$120. The company blamed this drop on lower shipments in South Korea, where the selling price is generally higher than other markets.
It's digital media division, which includes PCs, televisions and other consumer electronics, returned to operating profitability from a loss in the third quarter of last year. Flat-panel TV shipments jumped 24 percent year-on-year
Looking ahead, the company expects a good 2010.
"We expect the global economy recovery to drive growth for most products," said Robert Yi, vice president of Samsung's investor relations department. PC demand is expected to see close to double-digit growth, LCD close to 20 percent growth and cell phone handset growth in double digits.
