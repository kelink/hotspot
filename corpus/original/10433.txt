(Reuters) - European Goldfields Ltd EGU.TO EGUq.L won preliminary approval to develop a project in Greece expected to increase its gold production fivefold, boosting its share price and earning it a mention as a possible bid target.
"With these approvals now we can start building these projects and exploring for more," said David Reading, chief executive officer, noting the company produces about 70,000 ounces of gold a year.
"Our 420,000 ounces of gold from 2012 onwards would double current European gold production," he said.
Shares in the company rose 5.86 percent to 299.5 pence by 1134 GMT, compared with a 3.9 percent increase in the UK mining index .FTNMX1770.
European Goldfields, which slipped to a first half loss in August, has spent $120 million on the project and needs a further $330 million to bring everything to production by 2012. The firm has $150 million in the bank. [ID:nBNG347354]
The company hopes the permits there will be completed in March and that 160,000 ounces of gold a year will be produced there starting in the first quarter of 2012.
In the meantime, it is selling gold concentrate to China and produces lead, zinc and silver concentrate.
Louise Collinge, an analyst with Evolution Securities, said that while the Greek news was positive, the company still needed to complete the approval process and to get financing for about $400 million for the projects there and Romania.
Ambrian, a market maker in the company, maintained its "Buy" recommendation and raised its target price to 335 pence per share from 260 pence.
"We fully expect European Goldfields to become the largest gold producer on AIM in the medium term, and thereafter move to the main board or (potentially) be taken out, so a bid premium is certainly warranted," Mellor said.
