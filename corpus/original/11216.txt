(Reuters) - Chilean copper miner Antofagasta Plc (
However, the group raised its full-year copper production forecast to about 447,000 tonnes, ahead of the previous forecast of 433,000 tonnes, and expects to produce 7,200 tonnes of molybdenum.
EPS fell to 23.9 cents a share, compared with a consensus of 25.8 cents from 14 analysts polled by the London-listed company, from 80.4 cents the year-earlier period.
In July, the FTSE 100 miner reported a 6.6 percent decline in first-half copper output, slightly better than its own expectations, and said costs remained sharply higher than last year. [ID:nLT550750]
"Commodity prices have improved strongly since March this year and whilst the short-term outlook remains uncertain, both copper and molybdenum prices appear to have found higher support levels at this time," said Chief Executive Marcelo Awad.
Benchmark copper prices on the London Metal Exchange MCU3 have more than doubled this year, led by demand from top consumer China, but are still almost 30 percent below the record highs of $8,940 a tonne reached last July. [MET/L].
