Addax produced 134,730 barrels of oil a day in the first quarter, with more than three quarters of its output coming from properties in Nigeria.

"The decision comes down to one person and it comes down to price," Somerville said.
Addax shares rose C$3.20, or 8.9 percent, to C$39.20 on Monday afternoon on the Toronto Stock Exchange. (1=$1.12 Canadian) (Reporting by Scott Haggett; Editing by Frank McGurty)
