(Reuters) - China has the world's highest wind power capacity after adding 62 percent or 16 gigawatts (GW) in new capacity last year, the official Xinhua News Agency reported on Thursday.
The country's total installed wind power capacity reached 41.8 GW at the end of last year, the report said, citing Li Junfeng, secretary general of the Chinese Renewable Energy Industries Association.
Installed wind capacity in the United States increased by about 5 GW to 40.2 GW at the end of 2010, the report said, citing data from the Global Wind Energy Council.
Wind power capacity connected to grid networks totaled 22.94 GW at the end of August last year, according to the China Electricity Council.
China is considering ways to ensure grid connections for output generated from planned wind power capacity of 90 GW by 2015, China's National Energy Administration has said.
China would start building the second-phase of the 5 GW Jiuquan wind power project in Gansu province, the 2 GW Hami wind power project in Xinjiang, a 2 GW Kailu project in Inner Mongolia and the 1.5 GW Tongyu project in Jilin province this year, the Xinhua report said.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
You can read this same article on Chinadaily, but they leave out the reality that much of China¡¯s capacity is not used. Also, you should take into account that the US is using natural gas as a bridge from dirty to cleaner fuels. With a boom in alternative energy, the US should add billions to our own economy as we reduce imports of crude. The imports of crude alone reduce our GDP by at least 1 percent every year.
