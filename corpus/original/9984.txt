(Reuters) - Coal shortages restricted growth in India's overall power generation to an annual 7.5 percent in September, power regulator Central Electricity Authority said on Tuesday.
), it said in a statement.
India has 10 percent of the world's coal reserves, the biggest after the United States, Russia and China, but imports have grown rapidly from almost zero five years ago to an estimated 70 million tonnes in the current fiscal year.
The share of coal-fired plants in India's generation capacity will rise to 57 percent by March 2012 from the current 53.3 percent or 80,284 megawatts.
India produced nearly 63.57 billion kilowatt hours last month, up from 59.12 billion kilowatt hours a year ago, it said.

"Had the import of coal materialised and generation achieved at NTPC stations as planned, the growth rate of coal based generation would have been 6.4 percent," it said.
Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said on Tuesday that Coal India, which produces 82 percent of the country's coal, produced nearly 10 percent more in April-September at 184.44 million tonnes, compared with a year earlier.
He said coal sent to power utilities in April-September grew 1.6 percent to 140 million tonnes, despite constraints such as a shortage of railway wagons.
Thermal electricity, which accounts for about two-thirds of Indian power generation and includes generation using coal, gas and liquid fuel, grew about 8.99 percent annually in September.
India's peak power deficit -- the shortfall between supply and demand in peak hours -- in the month was 11.3 percent and the energy deficit -- shortages of fuel for power stations -- was 9.9 percent, the power regulator said.
"Out of 79 thermal stations, 33 power stations had critical stock, of which 19 stations had super critical stock position -- stock of less than 4 days as on Sep. 30," it said, adding total coal stock at thermal power station was 9.25 million tonnes as against a desired stock of 22 million tonnes.
