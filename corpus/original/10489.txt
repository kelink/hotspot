* A 1.3 percent coupon 2.1 trillion yen ($23.4 billion) 10-year debt auction is in focus. The sale drew attention as it is the first JGB tender of Japan's second fiscal half. The Ministry of Finance will release the tender results at 0345 GMT.
* Analysts expect the new 10-year JGBs to be well absorbed, eyeing demand from investors like domestic banks that want to extend the duration of their bond holdings as they seek higher returns further down the yield curve.
* "The auction comes at a good time as the market has not overheated prior to the sale. Ample demand is expected to emerge from investors eyeing further yield declines," said Noriyuki Fukuda, a fixed-income strategist at Morgan Stanley.
* But investors believe that longer-dated JGB yields may fall further. The two-year/10-year yield spread was at 102.5 basis points on Tuesday, just above a five-month low of 102 basis points reached the previous week according to Reuters data. r
