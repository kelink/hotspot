(Reuters) - China's insurance companies raised their investment portfolios by more than 5 percent in July, bringing the total for the first seven months to 2.45 trillion yuan ($358 billion), Xinhua reported on Sunday, citing the country's insurance regulator.
About 10 percent of capital investments in the first half of the year were in stocks, the regulator said, but it gave no comparative figure for Jan-July.
Bank deposits over seven months decreased to 1.03 trillion yuan, 15.23 billion yuan less than in the first six months, it said.
In July alone, investments from insurance funds stood at 120.4 billion yuan, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) said in a report on its website.
China's main stock index
rose more than 90 percent this year to early August before falling about 15 percent from its peak. Still, it is up nearly 63 percent so far this year.
), the world's second-biggest life insurer by market value, said last week it will keep stock investments at about 10 percent of its portfolio in the second half.
"The market has somewhat outpaced optimism of a good economic trend," Louis Cheung, its group president, said at a news conference days after reporting second-quarter earnings were boosted by strong investment returns.
The CIRC's figures also reflected a slowdown in the rise of premium income in the first seven months. Premium income was 678.64 billion yuan, representing a small increase of 80 billion yuan from June. (Reporting by Ken Wills; Editing by Jerry Norton)
