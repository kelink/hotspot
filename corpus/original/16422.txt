(Reuters) - TSMC (
), the world's top contract chip maker, booked its biggest monthly sales in seven months thanks to a pick-up in demand for chips used in computers and other consumer gagdets.
TSMC's May sales still fell from a year earlier but analysts say the result was in line with their expectations and TSMC was on track to meet its second-quarter sales target, even though a strong Taiwan dollar threatens to hurt its profit margins.

At its annual shareholders' meeting earlier on Wednesday, TSMC Chairman Morris Chang showed his confidence in the recovery.
"The worst for the semiconductor market has gone," Chang said.
TSMC has said it expects its second-quarter sales to rise to between T$71 billion and T$74 billion from the first quarter's T$39.5 billion, with gross profit margin reaching 43.5-45.5 percent in the same quarter. [ID:nTP343810]

Investors chased TSMC shares on Wednesday before the company released the sales results. TSMC shares rose 3.74 percent and UMC shares jumped 2.82 percent, outperforming the main TAIEX's 0.75 percent gain.
On a consolidated basis, TSMC's sales totalled T$87.2 billion in the first five months of the year, down 40 percent from a year ago, the company said in a statement.
