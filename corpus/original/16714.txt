MANILA, June 5
The 5-year bonds were priced at 8.25 percent and the 7-year paper at 9.1 percent, the company said, confirming figures given earlier by a source at lead underwriter BDO Capital and Investment Corp.
Proceeds from the bond sale will fund the expansion of the group, owned by one of the country's richest men, Henry Sy.
The company has said the bonds, with an initial offering size of 5 billion pesos and an option to double it, will be offered to the public from June 8 to June 18.
Other lead underwriters are BPI Capital Corp, China Banking Corp, Union Bank of the Philippines and RCBC Capital Corp.
In March, San Miguel Brewery SMB.PS raised 38.8 billion pesos from the sale of bonds in what was the Southeast Asian nation's biggest domestic corporate issue ever.
