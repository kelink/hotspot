(Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said two U.S. journalists jailed in North Korea had been granted access to Sweden's ambassador to Pyongyang on Friday, a move likely to be seen as a positive gesture by the North.
"The Swedish ambassador to North Korea, acting as the United States' protecting power, met with each of the two detained American citizen journalists on May 15," State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said.
The ambassador had previously met with them on March 30, Kelly added.
Euna Lee and Laura Ling, of U.S. media outlet Current TV, were arrested along the North Korea-China border in March. They were accused of illegally entering North Korea with "hostile" intent and Pyongyang has said they face criminal charges.
The journalists were arrested at a time of mounting tension between Washington and Pyongyang over North Korea's nuclear program.
Analysts have said the reclusive North sees the reporters as bargaining chips to try to win concessions from the government of U.S. President Barack Obama, which is pressing Pyongyang to return to stalled six-nation nuclear disarmament talks.
North Korea has pulled out of the talks, aimed at ending its nuclear ambitions, and said it is useless to talk to the Obama government, which it accuses of continuing a hostile policy to topple Pyongyang's leaders.
Earlier this week, Iran released an Iranian-American freelance journalist, Roxana Saberi, who had been jailed on charges of spying for the United States. Clinton appealed on multiple occasions for Saberi's freedom. (Reporting by Sue Pleming, editing by Patricia Zengerle)
