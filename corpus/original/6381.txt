China-U.S. talks to play down yuan: PBoC adviser

(Reuters) - China and the United States will largely sidestep the yuan at a summit next week because too much pressure would be counter-productive to getting Beijing to change its policy, a Chinese central bank adviser said in comments reported on Thursday.
Li Daokui, an academic adviser to the People's Bank of China, also said that the United States seemed less insistent now about pushing for yuan appreciation because it was aiming for broader cooperation with Beijing.
"Despite mounting pressure for a stronger yuan in the past few months, officials from both sides are expected to play down the currency issue during the meeting, leaving more leeway for China to decide the fate of its own currency," Li told the China Daily.
As one of three academic advisers on the central bank's monetary policy committee, Li has little, if any, influence over policy decisions but has knowledge of high-level thinking.
The United States will continue nudging China at the Strategic and Economic Dialogue next Monday and Tuesday to let the yuan appreciate, but trade issues appeared to be higher on the U.S. agenda ahead of the bilateral meetings.
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and the department's senior coordinator for Chinese affairs said on Wednesday they will urge China to see yuan appreciation as being in its own interest as well as that of the global economy.
China has held its currency at about 6.83 to the dollar since mid-2008, trying to buffer its economy from the ravages of the global financial crisis.
Many analysts and investors had thought that next week's summit or a G20 meeting in June were unofficial deadlines for Beijing to resume yuan appreciation, lest it face punitive measures from Washington.
But the deepening of sovereign debt worries in Europe coupled with signs of a stronger U.S. recovery have softened criticism of China's yuan policy and cast doubt on whether it is still under intense pressure to move.
