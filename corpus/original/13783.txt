* Shares up 9 pct (Adds conference call details, share movement, analyst comments)
), a maker of water heaters and electric motors, posted a quarterly profit that trumped market expectations and raised its 2009 earnings forecast, sending its shares up 9 percent.
"Revenue fell short of consensus while margins alone drove the positive surprise," Robert W Baird analyst Michael Schneider said in a note to clients.
Gross margins improved 2 percent during the quarter, with cost of goods sold down 22 percent at $376.3 million.
Schneider said cost of goods sold fell by $4 million sequentially, helped by lower raw material costs, a favorable product mix due to business in China and tight cost controls.
"We are expecting our China business to grow modestly in 2009. Our China water heater sales were up 16 percent in the second quarter after being down 10 percent in the first quarter," Chief Executive Paul Jones said on a conference call with analysts.
However, Jones said customers of its original equipment motor business have indicated that 2009 sales volumes will be substantially below last year, dropping 20 percent to 30 percent.
"As a result of the lower volumes, we have eliminated over 1000 jobs since the beginning of the year," Jones added.
A.O. Smith's end markets are mainly the residential and commercial construction industries, which have taken a beating in the slump.
The company reported second-quarter profit of $21.3 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with $9.5 million, or $1.00 a share, a year ago.
Excluding the impact of an accounting transaction, earnings were 79 cents per share, the company said.
According to Reuters Estimates, the company earned 72 cents a share, excluding items, topping analysts' average expectation of 49 cents a share.
Net sales fell 20 percent to $498.7 million, below market expectation of $534.7 million.
A.O. Smith raised its 2009 earnings outlook to between $2.15 and $2.35 per share. Excluding items, it now expects earnings of $2.05 to $2.25 a share for the year.
"Capital spending for the year is expected to be around $60 million, which is trimmed about $20 million as a result of our efforts to conserve cash," Chief Financial Officer Terry Murphy said on a call.
Shares of the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company pared initial gains to trade up $2.73, or 8 percent, at $38.27 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange. They had touched a high of $38.67 earlier in the session. (Reporting by Eric Yep in Bangalore; Editing by Himani Sarkar, Ratul Ray Chaudhuri)
