Shares in Naspers, which owns Africa's biggest pay-TV network DStv and has stakes in companies in China, Brazil, Russia and Europe, extended losses after Thursday's trading statement, falling 3.17 percent to 198.50 rand by 1241 GMT.
Headline EPS, the main profit gauge in South Africa which strips out certain one-off and non-trading items, was expected to drop due to a higher accounting charge related to recent acquisitions.
