(Reuters) - China's steel output hit 1.522 million tonnes per day in June 11-20, the highest daily output this year, according to data from the China Iron & Steel Association obtained by Reuters on Thursday.
The rate of output is equivalent to an annual production of 555.5 million tonnes, more than 10 percent above 2008 output of 500 million tonnes, and sets a pace that could leave June close to the all-time record for monthly steel production.
The accelerating rate of steel production will further weaken the case for a 40 percent cut in annual iron ore prices that CISA is demanding in talks with top mining firms, which have run past a June 30 deadline without agreement.
), BHP Billiton (
), the companies that control most of the global iron ore trade, to cut prices back to 2007 levels, which would mean a deeper cut in 2009 prices than many other steel mills have accepted.
Despite a slump on the global steel market, China's steel production has rebounded strongly this year after a slump at the end of 2008, spurred by a 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) state stimulus plan.
In June 2008, China produced 46.944 million tonnes of crude steel, the highest monthly volume ever, according to figures from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). May 2009 was the second-highest, at 46.46 million tonnes. NBS data and CISA data may show some discrepancies.
