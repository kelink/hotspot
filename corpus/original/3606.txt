(Reuters) - Crisis-hit car maker Saab SWAN.AS has received about 100 million crowns ($15 million), part of a bridge loan secured by China's Zhejiang Youngman Lotus Automobile that is key to the Swedish firm's short-term survival, daily Dagens Industri reported on Wednesday.
The money is part of a 70 million euro ($97 million) loan secured by Youngman that is intended to see Saab through a period of creditor protection until Chinese authorities OK a bigger investment by Youngman and China's Pangda (
Quoting unnamed sources, the paper said the money will be used to pay wages at Saab when a government salary insurance scheme runs out. The salary insurance plan kicked in when the company got creditor protection in late September
The paper said a decision by China's NDRC that Saab had expected on Thursday is likely to be delayed. However, the paper quoted a source with insight into the process as saying approvals should be wrapped up by mid-November.
Earlier on Wednesday, Pangda chairman Pang Qinghua said he was "confident" the firm's planned investment in Saab would go through.
In recent days, Swedish media have speculated that Saab's court-appointed administrator was close to ending Saab's period of credit protection, paving the way for the court to declare the firm bankrupt.
