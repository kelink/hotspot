Bain sees tepid recovery in global luxury sales in 2010

(Reuters) - The global market for luxury goods will shrink by 8 percent this year, according to Bain & Co, and grow just 1 percent next year, but the impact of the global recession has not been as severe as expected six months ago and currency appreciation has boosted Asian purchasing power.
In April, Bain estimated global luxury sales would decline 10 percent this year.
The U.S. consulting company said the first signs of a market recovery would emerge by the end of this year, forecasting fourth-quarter sales to drop just 1 percent from a year earlier. However, it said the market would grow only 1 percent in 2010 and not fully recover until 2011, when Bain expects a 4.2 percent increase in global sales.

Bain said luxury sales this year in Asia-Pacific ex-Japan would rise 10 percent, slightly better than last year's 9 percent growth, but well below 16 percent growth in 2007.
Rising Asian sales would be offset this year by an expected 16 percent drop in sales in the Americas, which accounted for nearly a third of the world market, it said
China remains the fastest-growing major market for luxury brands but projected sales growth this year of 12 percent will be less than half last year's 30 percent increase. Chinese sales were affected by the economic slowdown in the first quarter and the luxury market in top-tier cities Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou was already reaching maturity, Bain said.
Sales of luxury goods worldwide shrank last year for the first time, by 2 percent, as the global economic downturn and financial crisis battered consumer confidence and eroded wealth.
This year, sales in Europe, which account for 38 percent of global sales, are estimated to fall 8 percent, against a 1 percent decline in 2008.

Bain sees luxury sales in Japan, which has 12 percent of the world market, dropping 10 percent this year.
Sales were being hit by both the financial crisis and a generational shift as younger Japanese prefer mixing luxury goods with niche local brands, and new luxury store openings have been cancelled or delayed, Bain said.
The Asia-Pacific ex-Japan will see its share of the global market rise to 15 percent this year, from 13 percent in 2008. Currency appreciation in South Korea and some of its neighbours was giving Asian consumers more purchasing power, Bain said.
