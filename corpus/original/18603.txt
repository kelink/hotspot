), Andrew Forrest, may have to wait up to six months for a verdict in a civil case alleging he misled investors, according to lawyers and media reports on Friday.
During a five-week trial that ended on Thursday, market regulator the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) alleged Forrest misled investors by saying agreements in 2004 with Chinese companies were legally binding when they were only preliminary "framework" ones.
The agreements were over the building of a rail line to haul millions of tonnes of iron ore from a new outback mine to Australia's Port Hedland freighter terminal.
Fortescue has denied the allegations, arguing all of its disclosures were correct at the time and that it believed the deals would be converted to binding contracts.
Fortescue, the world's No.4 iron ore miner which sells all its output to China, recently won Australian government approval for China's state-owned Hunan Valin Iron and Steel Group to take up a 17.55 percent direct interest for $438 million.
