Nomura's results show it still faces challenges overseas

(Reuters) - Nomura's lackluster quarterly profit and rising costs show Japan's biggest brokerage faces formidable challenges in expanding overseas, a key strategy that an executive told Reuters will take it to China within a year and a half.
By buying the non-U.S. businesses of failed Lehman Brothers in 2008 and by boosting staffing in America, Nomura embarked on a strategy of seeking out profits in foreign markets as it became harder to make money at home.
The move, however, has yet to provide the big payoffs the Japanese broker has promised and Nomura has to convince impatient investors to stick with its bid to join the elite of global investment banking.
"I still do not see any energetic move outside Japan. We still have to wait and see how they are going to perform in the future," said Yuuki Sakurai, CEO & president of Fukoku Capital Management in Tokyo.
"Nomura didn't get the chunk of Lehman from the US, so they may have to fight very hard there. They don't have much time left to show results to their shareholders, Sakurai said, adding the brokerage will have to make a very big purchase in the United States in the near future to become a major global player.
Jesse Bhattal, the chief operating officer of Nomura's wholesale business, said in an interview Nomura's strategy will deliver and expansion overseas won't stop and will include Nomura establishing an investment banking presence.
"It is one of the most important geographies. We would like to over the next 12 to 18 months have a local market presence in China," Bhattal said.
Nomura's overseas expansion strategy is viewed as riskier than its main domestic rival Daiwa Securities Group's, which is focused only on Asia.
The cost of hiring and paying talent it needs to take into new markets is weighing on Nomura, whose latest quarterly profit, though its biggest in three quarters, is still a fraction of the earnings generated at top global investment banks such as Goldman Sachs.
In the third quarter, personnel costs rose to 48 percent of the brokerage's revenue from 46 percent in the previous quarter.
"Nomura still hasn't generated enough profit to justify the increase in costs overseas," said Tatsuo Majima, a brokerage analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Center. "The overseas trading business is not generating as much profits as it should."
Nomura posted a net profit of 13.39 billion yen ($164.6 million) for the three months ended December 31, compared with a profit of 10.2 billion yen a year ago and a 1.1 billion yen profit in the previous quarter ended September 30.
The profit fell short of the consensus forecast 17.4 billion yen from four analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. For the full business year to the end of March, the average net profit prediction of eight analysts is 36.7 billion yen. Nomura does not release its own outlook.
Shares of Nomura have lost about 40 percent since the Lehman acquisition, sharply underperforming the benchmark Nikkei average, which has gained 37 percent.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei average gained 9.2 percent in the most recent quarter compared with a 7.3 percent rise in New York's Dow industrials and a 6.3 percent increase in London's FTSE benchmark.
The Tokyo market's solid performance encouraged investors to put money into stock funds, helping boost Nomura's asset management business to a 34 percent quarter-on-quarter rise in income on an 11 percent increase in sales.
But profit at Nomura's global wholesale business, which include overseas stock and bond trading, fell 37 percent to 13.2 billion yen from the previous quarter, while the investment banking business suffered another loss.
Nomura offered many of its new employees guaranteed bonuses to keep them from leaving after the Lehman deal and must now look for ways to control costs as tighter financial capital requirements loom and in order to match the profitability of U.S. securities houses such as Goldman Sachs, analysts say.
Reflecting a rise in compensation and benefits, Nomura's non-interest expenses rose 6 percent from the prior quarter to 268.1 billion yen.
"They're (Nomura and Daiwa) expanding overseas so they're building their operations which means it takes a while for their revenues to flow in. But, meanwhile, the costs stay high," said Ehan Syed, an analyst at Fitch Ratings.
Nomura's shares closed 4 percent higher before the earnings announcement, in line with a rise in the securities subindex. ($1=81.34 Yen) (Additional reporting by Chris Gallagher; Editing by Nathan Layne and Muralikumar Anantharaman)
