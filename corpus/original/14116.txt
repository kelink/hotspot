(Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei average gained 2.2 percent on Tuesday, buoyed by exporters such as Sony Corp (
) jumped more than 6 percent after the Nikkei business daily said the company returned to profitability in the April-June quarter, helped by cost cuts and recovering demand in China and other emerging economies.
A halt in the yen's sharp appreciation against the dollar also helped the Nikkei rise from an eight-week closing low booked on Monday.
In comments to CNBC television, well-known analyst Meredith Whitney said U.S. bank shares were in for at least a short-term gain of 15 percent.
"After a recent bearish run, the market has been looking an opportunity to rebound, and the analyst comments on the financial sector fit the bill," said Yutaka Miura, senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities.
Whitney said major financials, including Bank of America Corp (
), which along with Goldman Sachs (
) are scheduled to report results this week, could do well in the second quarter.
Whitney, who has in the past been bearish, also upgraded Goldman to "buy," driving its stock higher.
"But we won't know anything for sure until we see their actual numbers. I expect today's gains to be somewhat limited," said Miura.
In moderate trade, the benchmark Nikkei
advanced 201.05 points to 9,251.38. It slid 2.6 percent the previous day to hit its lowest finish since May 18 and for its ninth day of falls. It lost 9.1 percent over that nine-day period.
In early Asia trade, the dollar was trading around 93 yen after hitting a five-month trough of 91.73 yen. Investors welcome a weaker yen as it boosts exporters' profits when they are repatriated.
