(Reuters) - Chilean copper miner Antofagasta Plc (
The group raised its full-year copper production forecast to about 447,000 tonnes, ahead of the previous forecast of 433,000 tonnes, but cut its molybdenum output guidance to 7,200 tonnes from 8,100 tonnes.
Earnings per share (EPS) slumped to 23.9 cents compared with a consensus forecast of 25.8 cents from 14 analysts polled by the London-listed company, from 80.4 cents the year-earlier period. Revenue fell 51 percent on lower metal prices and a decline in copper output.
Benchmark copper prices on the London Metal Exchange MCU3 have more than doubled this year, led by demand from top consumer China, but are still almost 30 percent below the record highs of $8,940 a tonne reached last July. [MET/L]
"Commodity prices have improved strongly since March this year and whilst the short-term outlook remains uncertain, both copper and molybdenum prices appear to have found higher support levels at this time," said Chief Executive Marcelo Awad.
Shares in the FTSE 100 miner were down 1.0 percent at 781-1/2 pence at 0734 GMT, underperforming a 0.5 percent climb in the UK mining index .FTNMX1770.
Analysts at Cazenove said the results were lower than it expected, mainly due to the group's realised copper price having a less positive impact than anticipated, and called the outlook "fairly cautious".
Antofagasta plans to pay an interim dividend of 3.4 cents per share, unchanged from the year earlier, but will not pay a special dividend as it has in the past few years.
"(The) Absence of a special dividend is not a particular surprise given the capital requirements on the business this year and next, plus the relatively low level of cashflow generation in H1," Cazenove analysts said in a research note.
Antofagasta said its expansion projects at Los Pelambres and Esperanza are expected to raise group copper production to around 550,000 tonnes in 2010 and to almost 700,000 tonnes in 2011.
In July, the miner reported a 6.6 percent decline in first-half copper output. [ID:nLT550750]
Cash costs, excluding by-product credits from molybdenum, fell 11 percent to 116.0 cents per pound in the first half, helped by a cost cutting programme, lower energy and acid prices and a weaker Chilean peso.
It expects full-year cash costs before by-product credits of about 117 cents a pound, up from the original forecast of around 110 cents, on higher energy and fuel costs and a stronger peso.
