FOREX-Yen rises on China's lackluster data, risk aversion

(Reuters) - The Japanese yen rose broadly on Tuesday as investors bought the low-yielding currency as U.S. stocks declined and on rising risk aversion after disappointing economic data from China.
China reported below-forecast growth in factory output and investment, reminding investors that the world's third-largest economy is not yet back on a solid footing. (For details, see [ID:nPEK328668]).
The news also added to the currency woes of the so-called commodity-bloc countries that supply raw materials to China, such as Australia and Canada. The commodity-bloc currencies were among Tuesday's biggest decliners against the U.S. dollar.
The dollar traded in a tight range, swinging between gains and losses against a basket of currencies and as investors awaited a policy statement from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday and speculated whether strong U.S. data would support the currency.
U.S. jobs data last week boosted expectations for higher U.S. interest rates by early 2010, but with a Fed announcement looming some dollar investors chose to wait rather than continue to buy.
"Chinese economic news is likely playing a part in today's forex market activity," said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo Bank in New York. "And with China seen as the global economy's main growth engine during the early stages of recovery, the disappointment (with the data) is weighing on equities and on the commodity-based and emerging currencies."

The dollar index edged lower at 79.143 .DXY, swinging between 79.355 and 79.008.
"We're in consolidation mode right now as the anticipation builds for the Fed statement tomorrow afternoon," said Brian Dolan, chief currency strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey. "The Fed will acknowledge some better data but also downplay the idea that an exit strategy will start soon."
The Fed is expected to keep rates steady at 0-0.25 percent on Wednesday but paint a slightly brighter economic picture while dampening speculation about a rate hike. It is also likely to end its $300 billion Treasury purchases program, as scheduled.
