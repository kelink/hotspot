UPDATE 2-Old Mutual pulls out of China fund manager buy

(Reuters) - Insurer Old Mutual (
) pulled out of buying a 49 percent stake in China's ABN AMRO Teda Fund Management on Wednesday as part of a drive to streamline its businesses.
Old Mutual, South Africa's largest insurer, said in March it would scale back its expansion in Asia following a review of the company instigated by Chief Executive Julian Roberts after he took the helm last September.
"We didn't feel it was sensible at this time to pursue a growth strategy in the Asian region ... that was one of the conclusions of the review that we did," an Old Mutual spokesman said on Wednesday.
However that was just a month before U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed, wreaking havoc across financial markets and sparking a wave of government-backed bank bailouts around the world.
At the time, the two sides said the sale of the stake, which had belonged to Dutch bank ABN AMRO, was required by regulators after Fortis took on ABN's asset management business in April last year.
France's BNP Paribas (
) has since taken control of Fortis Bank, formerly the Belgian banking arm of stricken financial group Fortis FOR.BR, which was broken apart by the Belgian and the Netherlands in October.
A spokeswoman for the new BNP Paribas Fortis said it was too early to say whether it still wanted to sell its stake in the joint venture or indeed whether it would still have to do so, adding that the business was sound.
Shares in the Anglo-South African Old Mutual were up 2.1 percent at 71.6 pence at 1027 GMT, against a 0.7 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx European insurers index .SXIP. (Reporting by Ben Deighton in London and Philip Blenkinsop in Brussels; Editing by Will Waterman and Erica Billingham)
