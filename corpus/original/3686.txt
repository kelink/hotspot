While scientists are uncertain if this new strain -- called H5N1-2.3.2.1 -- is more virulent in people, they said it was different enough from its predecessor to escape a human H5N1 vaccine that can tackle the parent strain.
"There is a human H5N1 vaccine candidate that is a (WHO) recommended vaccine ... But it doesn't confer full protection against the (new variant)," said leading virologist Malik Peiris at the University of Hong Kong.
World Health Organization experts meet twice a year, in February and September, to discuss and decide on the makeup of candidate influenza vaccines.
H5N1 kills up to 60 percent of the people it infects. It has resurfaced in recent months, most notably in Cambodia where it has infected eight people this year, killing all of them.
"H5N1 cases in Cambodia always have high mortality because they are detected late," Peiris told Reuters in an interview.
"It doesn't necessarily indicate that this particular virus strain is more virulent to humans. But it is a threat because it has become more widespread globally."
