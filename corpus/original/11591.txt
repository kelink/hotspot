UPDATE 1-Colombian Senate approves Uribe re-election bill

(Reuters) - Colombian President Alvaro Uribe moved closer to a 2010 re-election bid on Wednesday when the Senate approved a bill aimed at allowing him run for a third term, part of a push to extend his popular security policies.
The bill calls for a referendum asking voters if they want to amend the constitution to allow the president, known for his investor-friendly policies, to run again in May's election.
Uribe is Washington's main ally in the Andean region, where neighboring governments regularly criticize U.S. policy and are strengthening ties with Russia, China and Iran.
But even some of his staunchest supporters from Bogota to Washington to Wall Street say a third term could throw off the country's balance of power.
Despite being gripped by a 45-year-old Marxist insurgency, Colombia has enjoyed stable democratic institutions compared with the rest of Latin America.
"Unfortunately Uribe is putting an end to this seriousness and turning us into a banana republic," opposition Senator Juan Cristo has said in arguing against the referendum.
The socialist leaders of Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia have also pushed to extend their time in power. The three have blasted a pending deal to increase the U.S. military presence in Colombia to help fight insurgents and the cocaine trade.
Even if Uribe does not run again, Colombia's tough security stance is unlikely to change. The leading alternative candidate is hard-liner Juan Manuel Santos, a former defense minister.
For weeks analysts had said the referendum bill was dead, as Uribe grappled with a slowing economy and a series of vote-buying scandals that have implicated administration officials.
But his government launched an all-out lobbying effort in recent days to convince lawmakers to vote for the measure. (Additional reporting by Monica Garcia; editing by Chris Wilson)
