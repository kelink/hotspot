) jumped over 42 percent Monday on heavy volumes, following its regulator-assisted acquisition of key rival United Commercial Bank (UCB), a unit of UCBH Holdings Inc UCBH.O.
The deal, which comes with reduced risk because of the FDIC backstop on future credit losses, ups East West's asset base more than 50 percent to $19 billion and expands its presence among the Chinese-American population it primarily serves.
"This is a highly attractive acquisition for East West because it takes out one of its long-time key competitors, making it the dominant bank in the Chinese-American bank niche," BMO Capital Markets' Lana Chan said.
Chan raised her price target on the bank's stock to $15 from $12.
East West, which caters to the Chinese community in the United States, acquired San Francisco-based UCB in a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp-assisted transaction late on Friday, which includes UCB's 63 U.S. branches, a branch in Hong Kong and a subsidiary, UCB-China, in Shanghai. [ID:nN06212635]
"The deal also includes UCB-China, which gives East West a rare and valuable Chinese banking license," analyst Joe Morford of RBC Capital Markets said in a note to clients.
On Friday, East West said it completed a capital raise of $500 million through the private placement of 18.2 million shares of common stock, priced at $9.04 per share.
Shares of East West were the biggest percentage gainers in early trade on the Nasdaq, up almost 50 percent at $12.80 with the number of shares traded more than double their 50-day moving average volume.
