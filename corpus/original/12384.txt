Q+A: Why did China detain Rio's mining executives?
2009-08-09 20:48:00.0
(Reuters) - China's state secrets watchdog has accused mining multinational Rio Tinto of engaging in commercial spying for six years, saying data found on Rio computers showed the spying came at a huge loss to China.
WHO IS BEING HELD?
Stern Hu, Rio Tinto's head of iron ore marketing in China, and three other members of the Shanghai-based iron ore team were detained in early July for "stealing state secrets."
Hu, a Chinese-born Australian citizen, was accused of obtaining and passing on the Chinese industry's negotiating position, sources said.
Rio's China team carry out some negotiations and manage operational details of term contracts for iron ore, a key ingredient in steel making, as well as tracking market information.
An iron ore executive from China's eighth-largest mill, Shougang, is also in custody, Chinese media reported. Executives from other big Chinese mills are also being questioned.
WHAT IS SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THE TIMING OF THE ARRESTS?
They came at a sensitive time, as Chinese steel mills had reportedly given in after protracted annual iron ore price negotiations, while their official representative, the China Iron and Steel Association, held out for deeper cuts than those obtained by Japanese and Korean steelmakers.
Traditionally, all steel mills accept whatever deal is settled first between any mill and any of the big three miners, Rio, BHP Billiton and Brazil's Vale.
WHY WERE THE EXECUTIVES DETAINED?
It's possible that the case is exactly that -- illegally obtaining sensitive information -- but the timing and the targets have also given rise to other explanations.
Some steel industry observers see the developments as an attempt by the steel association, which had vowed to the central government that it would achieve a better deal on iron ore prices, to reassert control and save face after the Chinese mills' reported capitulation.
There are also a lot of hard feelings between China and Rio Tinto after Rio ended a buy-in by China's flagship aluminum firm Chinalco.
The Sydney Morning Herald said it could reflect a structural shake-up of China's economic management in the wake of the global financial crisis, as the Communist Party's nine-member standing committee, led by President Hu Jintao, exerts more control over economic decisions at the expense of the State Council, led by Premier Wen Jiabao.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
The investigation raises the specter of a wider purge, which could deprive the steel industry of some of its savvier executives and widen the rift between the mills and the association.
The future of Hu Stern and his colleagues is uncertain. Under Chinese law, detainees may be held for some time without being charged, and interrogated without access to legal counsel. Once charged and formally arrested, the judicial process can begin.
But at the end of the day, the trade will go on.
Top iron ore consumer China needs Australia's high quality, reliable supply of ore, used to make steel that goes into everything from bridges to skyscrapers to washing machines.
And top exporter, Australia, needs China's steel mills, which consume half the world's ore output every year.
