(Reuters) - China raised its interest rates twice this year and increased the reserve ratio six times for banks in a bid to mop up excess liquidity in the market. Below is a timeline of the rate changes in 2010, and market reaction.
December 25: China's central bank lifts benchmark one-year deposit and lending rates by 25 basis points on Christmas Day in a bid to head off price pressures which have raced to a 28-month high.
- Chinese investors went from relief to apprehension of more tightening ahead, pushing the Shanghai stock market down 1.9 percent on Monday after earlier gains. Stock market punters initially piled into sectors seen as potentially benefiting from higher interest rates, including banks and insurers, but those bets reversed in the last hour of trade.
Chinese equities have been generally resilient to interest rate rises. Before Saturday, A shares had risen on average 2.9 percent in the week after the past 10 benchmark interest rate increases in China and 7.8 percent a month later. The Hang Seng Chinese Enterprises index had risen on average 2.2 percent after a week and 6.3 percent after a month.
- The Australian dollar and commodities pared early losses as investors bet China's latest interest rate hike would not change the optimistic outlook for the global economy in 2011.
- While commodity markets had expected a rate rise following a recent shift in monetary policy, the timing was a surprise, but markets recovered from early losses on expectations the measures would do little to curb China's appetite for industrial raw materials, energy, grains and other agricultural products.
October 19: China's central bank raises its benchmark one-year lending and deposit rates by 25 basis points, its first rate hike since 2007.
The quarter point increase was also the first time in modern history that Beijing adjusted deposit and lending levels by a number that was not a multiple of nine. In the past, the central bank typically raised rates by 27 basis points. On the abacus, adding multiples of nine was much easier than adding multiples of 10.
- World stocks and commodity prices fell sharply. Crude oil slid more than 4 percent, its biggest single-day percentage decline in eight months, while copper tumbled from 27-month highs and gold shed as much as 2.7 percent, its largest one-day drop since early July. The dollar rallied broadly, while the Australian dollar, which had just risen above parity with the U.S. currency for the first time since 1983, was hit hardest, slipping 1.5 percent.
- China's bond yields surged to an eight-month high after the central bank's surprise rate rise sparked fears of a sustained tightening campaign, but authorities kept a lid on the yuan to ward off hot money inflows.
- China's stock market closed nearly flat after a day of volatile trading during which it lost as much as 2.0 percent but also gained as much as 1.3 percent at one point. The Shanghai Composite Index ultimately inched up 0.1 percent for the day, as liquidity in the financial sector remains ample despite the marginal increase in the cost of funds.
December 10 : China's central bank raises lenders' required reserves by 50 basis points to 19 percent, a record high.
November 19 : The People's Bank of China lifts required reserve ratios by 50 basis points to 18.5 percent for big banks.
- Stocks inched lower and commodities fell, but a tense market remained more focused on hopes of an Irish bailout and its broader implications for euro zone debt.par
November 10: China's central bank has ordered some banks to lift their required reserve ratios by 50 basis points in an apparent effort to curb rapid credit growth, three industry sources told Reuters.
- Stocks and copper prices fell, but more because of slower-than-expected China import data, and continued worries over the Irish debt problem and its fallout on the euro.
October 11: China has raised reserve requirements for six large commercial banks on a temporary basis, a surprise move to drain cash from the economy but avoid over-tightening. The 50-basis-point increase, which takes required reserve ratios to 17.5 percent for the country's biggest lenders, is the first since May.
- Global markets tumbled earlier this year when China raised reserve requirements, but on this occasion investors took the news in their stride. The Australian dollar, which is sensitive to the strength of the Chinese economy -- the top Australian export destination -- came under brief selling pressure before paring its losses.
May 2: PBOC raises lenders' reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points to 17 percent.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
China will have to deal with inflation using all the tools in the hands of administration. Central bank has already increased reserve ratio for banks and is increasing interest rates step by step but has failed to arrest rising inflation as reported in media. Further it need to rationalize printing of currency & put more material resources in the hands of common people which are getting siphoned off for super speed growth of public sector creating idle capacity beyond the reach of most. Vacant housing capacity is an indication of forming of a housing bubble which can burst under the impact of rising interest. China must learn that it cannot always maintain high GDP growth rate maintaining very low interest rates and inflation at the same time and have to keep room for continuous adjustments!
