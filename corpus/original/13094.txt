) posted an 86 percent fall in quarterly operating profits, hit by a stronger yen and declining car sales, and kept its forecasts for an annual loss unchanged as a lack of hybrid cars overshadowed solid sales in China.
Japan's No.3 automaker reported an operating profit of 11.6 billion yen ($122.9 million) in April-June, down from a profit of 80 billion yen a year earlier but beating a consensus loss estimate of 117 billion yen in a poll of four analysts by Thomson Reuters.
Nissan, held 44 percent by France's Renault SA (
), lost a net 16.5 billion yen in the first quarter, against a profit of 52.8 billion yen a year ago.
For the financial year to March 31, 2010, Nissan kept its operating loss forecast at 100 billion yen and its net loss forecast at 170 billion yen.
Predicting no convincing recovery in global car demand for at least a year, Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn has previously said Nissan will focus on returning to positive free cash flow through joint cost-cutting effort with Renault.
Shares in Nissan have almost doubled in price this year, making them the best performer among Japanese auto shares. Tokyo's transport sub-index .ITEQP.T gained 44 percent in the same period. ($1=94.38 Yen) (Reporting by Chang-Ran Kim; Editing by Lincoln Feast)
