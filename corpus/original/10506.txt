UPDATE 1-Powerlong cuts HK IPO price, delays debut
Mon  EDT
) said it will delay its trading debut in Hong Kong after pricing its IPO below an indicative range amid weak demand, as sentiment sours for new offerings.
Fujian-based Powerlong pushed back its debut date to Oct. 14 from the previously planned Oct. 9, allowing retail investors to decide whether they want to cancel their orders, the company said in a supplemental listing document late on Monday.
It made the delay as the retail portion of deal was 22 percent under-subscribed, the worst performance by an offering this year.
The weak reception bodes poorly for other companies coming to market, including China Resources Cement (
), which is due to make its trading debut on Tuesday, and Wynn Macau (
), which is set to debut on Friday.
Powerlong priced its IPO shares at HK$2.75 each, or 17 percent below the indicative range of HK$3.30 to HK$4.90 after a series of poor trading debuts in Hong Kong damped investor appetite for new offerings.
The company had aimed to raise HK$5 billion ($641 million) from the offering, but will now have to settle for HK$2.75 billion.
A flood of new offerings onto the market over the last month as companies raced to raise money after nearly a year of inactivity during the global financial crisis also cooled demand for IPO shares. (Reporting by Doug Young and Alison Leung; Editing by Chris Lewis)
