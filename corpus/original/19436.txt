) posted a surprise quarterly adjusted profit as tight cost control helped offset a drop in sales, and said it would lay off 250 management employees to cut expenses further.
Hanesbrands, which also makes casual wear and active wear, expects to incur restructuring and related charges of about $15 million primarily in the second quarter.
In January, the company cut 310 jobs. As of April 15, it had about 45,000 employees.
"Given the sales declines that we are seeing we felt we needed to take swift and important action," a company executive said on a conference call with analysts. Hanesbrands has seen declining sales in three of its last four quarters.
For the quarter ended April 4, the company posted a net loss of $19.3 million, or 20 cents a share, compared with a net profit of $36.0 million, or 38 cents a share, a year ago.
The company said, excluding actions, it earned 3 cents a share for the latest first quarter.
Total net sales fell about 13 percent to $857.8 million. Sales fell across all its four segments -- innerwear, outerwear, international and hosiery.
Analysts on average were expecting a loss of 5 cents a share, before items, on revenue of $871.3 million, according to Reuters Estimates.
Hanesbrands also said it has decided to start production at its new Nanjing, China plant on Oct. 12 this year.
Shares of the company, which was spun off from U.S. foodmaker Sara Lee Corp SLE.N in 2006, were trading at $13.08 after the bell. They closed at $13.75 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Mihir Dalal in Bangalore; Editing by Himani Sarkar)
