(Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama will travel to Japan, Singapore, China and South Korea in mid-November, the White House said on Wednesday.
Obama will leave Washington on November 11 and go to Japan on November 12-13, where he will meet for a second time with Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said at a daily briefing.
Obama will next go to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit on November 13-15 in Singapore, where he will also hold bilateral meetings with leaders from Singapore and other countries, and hold the first meeting between a U.S. president and leaders of the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Gibbs said.
He will then travel to China, visiting Beijing and Shanghai
on November 14-18 and holding his third bilateral meeting with President Hu Jintao to discuss issues including security, nonproliferation, energy and climate change.
Obama will also travel to Seoul, South Korea, on November 18-19, when he will hold a third bilateral meeting with President Lee Myung-bak and consult on North Korea, among other issues. He will also meet with U.S. troops stationed there, Gibbs said.
As he discussed the trip, Gibbs brought up Indonesia, a major U.S. ally in the region that is not included on Obama's itinerary. Gibbs said Obama and Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono had agreed last month at the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh that the best time for Obama to visit would be next year.
