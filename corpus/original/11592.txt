YUKIO HATOYAMA, PARTY LEADER, Aug. 4:
"With regards to U.S. Treasuries, that's something we need to be careful over. We will judge it carefully after taking power."
TSUTOMU OKUBO, DEPUTY SPOKESMAN ON FINANCE, July 8:
Has said keeping the dollar as the world's main reserve currency is in Japan's interests.
"There's no reason we should limit dollar investment in the forex reserves to U.S. Treasuries.

FUJII, July 16:
NAKAGAWA, June 10:
He also said Japan should consider suggesting the U.S. issues yen-denominated bonds if Washington asks Tokyo to buy more U.S. government debt, but has also said in the past this did not mean Tokyo should stop buying dollar-denominated U.S. bonds.
OKUBO, July 8:
TETSURO FUKUYAMA, DEPUTY POLICY CHIEF, July 15:
NAOKI MINEZAKI, ACTING HEAD OF PARTY'S TAX COUNCIL, June 11:
"The BOJ's policy has become a servant of fiscal policy. There are signs deflation is becoming serious but when we need to normalise financial conditions we need to raise rates more."
NAKAGAWA, June 10:
"The BOJ is shackled by Japan's poor fiscal conditions."
(On the BOJ's buying of JGBs) "It affects confidence in the central bank. It is up to the BOJ to decide."
HATOYAMA, Aug. 10 magazine article:
"... as an extension of the high economic development led by Japan, followed by South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and also realised by ASEAN and China, it is necessary to set a target to realise a 'common Asian currency' and to unify currencies regionally, and to work hard to create a permanent security framework in East Asia, which would serve as a backbone to that."
"It will take more than 10 years to realize the common Asian currency. And for that to bring political unity, it will probably require more time."
OTSUKA, Aug. 7:
"There may be some room for the BOJ to help government finance, but we would not ask it to monetise government debt in advance."
MASAYUKI NAOSHIMA, POLICY CHIEF, July 27:
But he added: "There's also a view that the economy could go into decline. In that case, we would have no choice but to consider taking steps to shore up the economy as an emergency measure and it's possible we may have to issue deficit-covering bonds."
FUJII, July 16:
"It is important to cut more than 10 percent of new government bond issuance. This is important for both Japan's fiscal health and JGB markets." (Reporting by Tokyo Bureau; Compiled by Charlotte Cooper and Linda Sieg)
