(Reuters) - International model and collectibles group Hornby (
"The Group has experienced challenging circumstances over the past year, with supply chain issues and adverse currency effects putting a short-term brake on our financial performance," Chairman Neil Johnson said in a trading update relating to the period from April 1.
He said that there had been no major changes to the company's position since its report covering its financial year ending March 31.
"Current indications are positive and historically hobby products such as ours have performed relatively well in times of consumer uncertainty," added Johnson.
He said sales in Germany, the largest model railway market in Europe, had been encouraging and better performance by the new owners of its principal suppliers based in China had led to a significant improvement in deliveries.
"Our businesses in the UK, mainland Europe and the USA have continued to experience good demand for our products."
Johnson said Hornby planned to launch a new range of die-cast vehicles and figurines related to the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the former available from Corgi before this Christmas, after winning a licence.
"Hornby, Scalextric and Airfix products will follow as the momentum builds towards 2012," he added.
"We see this licence as giving a once in a lifetime opportunity for consumers to build a unique collection of London 2012 memorabilia over the course of the next three years." ($1=.6067 Pound) (Writing by Jon Bramley; Editing by Mike Nesbit)
