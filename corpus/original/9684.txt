GE CFO sees slower restructuring in 2010

(Reuters) - General Electric Co will slow the pace of restructuring and job cutting next year as it looks ahead to what it expects to be a recovering global economy, a top executive said on Friday.
"There will be significantly less restructuring in 2010 than 2009," Chief Financial Officer Keith Sherin said in an interview.
The biggest U.S. conglomerate has cut an undisclosed number of jobs over the past year, with many coming at the GE Capital finance arm the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company is scaling back after a sharp drop in profit during the credit crunch.
"The dramatic changes in the company clearly have been driven by the downsizing of GE Capital," Sherin said. "That's not going to continue at that pace."
The world's biggest maker of electricity-producing turbines and jet engines reported a 42 percent drop in profit on Friday, with revenue down 20 percent.
That drop in revenue would have been sharper without GE's big emerging markets footprint, Sherin said. Sales to developing countries are up 1 percent so far this year, lead by China, where GE has seen sales rise 26 percent.
"This is the importance of being a big, global company, to be able to capture that revenue where it exists," Sherin said.
Growth in China could slow from that pace, Sherin allowed, but he noted the country's growing consumer power was sparking demand for health care equipment, as well as the energy gear that it has bought as it builds its infrastructure.
"We feel very good about China being a continued growth engine for the company," Sherin added.
