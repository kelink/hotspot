(Reuters) - Taiwan and China signed deals on financial services and new direct flights on Sunday to facilitate business between the two sides, useful especially for recession-hit Taiwan.
China and Taiwan laid the groundwork for letting each other's financial services firms do broader business on the other side.
On Sunday they announced a framework paving the way for banks, insurers and other financial service providers to invest and do business in each others' markets. They also said they will establish a currency clearing system between the Taiwan dollar and the Chinese yuan.
China and Taiwan signed an agreement allowing the first scheduled direct flights between the two sides, which once banned air links for security reasons. Scheduled flights replace charters, easing passage for 750,000 Taiwanese who do business in China and for Chinese tourists in Taiwan.
* FUTURE FREE TRADE DEAL, JOINT CRIME FIGHTING
The two sides agreed to investigate and prosecute each other's criminal suspects. They also mentioned opening the door for Chinese investment in Taiwan in the future and potential for a free trade-style agreement, though details on both points were vague.
Communist China has claimed self-ruled Taiwan since 1949 and vowed to bring the island under its rule, by force if necessary. But since Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou took office last May, the China-friendly leader has eased tension with Beijing through trade and transit deals signed during talks last year.
The two sides have agreed to put off discussing tough political issues for now, handling less sensitive economic matters first. Negotiators are expected to meet formally again later in the year, in Taiwan.
