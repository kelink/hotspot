Most EU states oppose Chinese solar panel duties: diplomats

(Reuters) - A majority of EU governments oppose the European Commission's plans to levy prohibitive duties on solar panel imports from China, a survey of member states by Reuters showed on Monday, weakening Brussels' efforts to pressure Beijing.
The European Commission is set to impose duties averaging 47 percent in place from June 6, but the sanctions are provisional and EU trade chief Karel De Gucht is seeking a negotiated solution with the Chinese government.
The EU's 27 countries had until Friday to submit a written response to De Gucht's plans to go ahead with the duties, in a non-binding vote that nonetheless has a strong bearing on the Commission's room for maneuver.
Fearful of losing business in China, Germany, Britain and the Netherlands are among a group of at least 14 member states who oppose the measures, diplomats told Reuters during a survey of countries' positions.

One cannot help empathies with German Chancellors Merkel¡¯s puppets in Brussels( AKA The federalist golden trough, snout gobbling commissionaires association )as two weeks ago she order them to pass a bill imposing import sanctions of 47% on Chinese goods. Her reason for doing so was to save the German solar panel companies from going bust as they were unable to compete with the cheaper Chinese versions. Yet now having been told by the Chinese that intend to slap a 47% import duty on all German goods Merkel now tells her puppets to scrap the bill and not implement the sanctions on China. This is not a German U turn on the question of punitive EU import taxes on Chinese goods it is a triple summersault with one and a half twists, piked with tuck, degree of difficult 9.99999 r. But the beauty of being a dictator is that you can do whatever you like whenever you like and no one dare do a thing to stop you. Please be upstanding for the EU federal national anthem ¡°Deutschland, Deutschland ¨¹ber alles¡± (literally, ¡°Germany, Germany above all¡±),
