(Reuters) - Papua New Guinea has sent police reinforcements to several highland towns to protect Chinese-run businesses after a wave of looting in recent days, police said on Monday.
Looters have attacked Chinese businesses since last Wednesday, as a wave of anti-Chinese sentiment spread across the South Pacific island nation.
An anti-Asian immigration march in the capital Port Moresby last week sparked the rioting, with many Papua New Guineans blaming the Chinese for their poor standard of living and unfair business practices, said local newspapers. [ID:nSYD472356]
"We've increased the police presence in the main centres where we expect that incidents might occur," police spokesman Dominik Kakas told New Zealand Radio International.
"We've got additional manpower there to monitor the situation, that's in Madang, Kainantu, Goroka, and the NCD (capital Port Moresby)," he said.
PNG's police commissioners were not available for comment.
"Rogue Chinese...are responsible for creating disharmony between our two people. They should be blamed for the riots," an association spokesman told The National newspaper on Monday.
"Chinese citizens who break the law must face the consequences," said the unnamed spokesman.
A mountainous nation of some 6 million people north of Australia, Papua New Guinea is rich in a variety of minerals and other resources but has significant crime problems.
Last week, construction of a $1.7 billion nickel mine and processing plant was temporarily stopped after a fight between about 70 Papua New Guinean and Chinese workers. [ID:nSYD391382]
The project is majority-owned by state-owned China Metallurgical Construction Group Corp. Local workers protested last year over working conditions at the remote site. (Writing by Michael Perry; Editing by Valerie Lee)
