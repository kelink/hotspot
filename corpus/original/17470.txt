Equities rally lifts soybeans; corn and wheat dip

(Reuters) - U.S. soybean futures rose modestly on Tuesday as soaring equities encouraged funds to buy commodities, but corn and wheat were lower on profit-taking after last week's sharp gains.
"If you look at equities, you got a good bounce in the financials and there is a fair amount of investment money coming into commodities," said Shawn McCambridge, analyst for Prudential Bache Commodities.
after data from an industry group showed that consumer confidence rose in May, boosting optimism that the recession may be abating.
At 10:59 a.m. CDT soy for July delivery was up 7 cents per bushel at $11.73, July delivery corn was down 3 cents at $4.27-1/4 and wheat for July was down 1 cent at $6.11-1/2.
Fund buying last week boosted soybeans to a 7-1/2 month high, corn to a 6-1/2 month peak and wheat to a four-month high.
Traders and analysts also were awaiting release late on Tuesday of the updated U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) weekly crop progress report.
Wet weather has slowed corn and soybean plantings in the United States, threatening to reduce production at a time every bushel is needed to meet the growing demand from the livestock feeding and alternative fuels industries.
Better planting weather was seen last week and traders were expecting USDA to show corn plantings at about 80 to 85 percent complete. That would be up from the previous week's estimate of 62 percent but off the five-year average of 94 percent for late May. Soy seedings were expected at 45 to 50 percent, below the five-year average of roughly 67 percent.
The USDA on Tuesday said U.S. soy inspected for export last week totaled 17.0 million bushels, above trade estimates for 12.0 million to 14.0 million.
There have been reports that some companies were forecasting this year's U.S. soy supply to fall below 100 million bushels to as low as 75 million, roughly a one-week supply.
China's Commerce Ministry expects the country's soybean imports to hit a record 4.29 million tonnes in May and to remain high in June, with 4.11 million tonnes expected to arrive.
