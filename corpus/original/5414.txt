Stocks and commodities sink on Irish crisis and China
2010-11-16 18:31:00.0
(Reuters) - World stocks fell for the seventh straight session on Tuesday as growing tensions about Europe's debt problems and expectations of tighter credit in China weighed on commodity prices and hurt investor sentiment.
The U.S. dollar rose to a seven-week high against major currencies as anxiety about the outcome of Ireland's debt crisis sent the euro below $1.35.
Major U.S. stock indexes lost more than 1.5 percent while Japanese stocks were headed for a tepid start, with Nikkei futures traded in Chicago flat at 9,705.00 points.
Ireland's bond yields rose while euro zone finance ministers discussed in Brussels a solution for the crisis.
A joint mission of the European Central Bank, the EU Commission and the International Monetary Fund will head to Ireland in the next few days to look for ways to support the country, especially its banks, the ministers said.
Despite the apparent readiness of the European Union to come up with a rescue plan for Ireland, Dublin resisted agreeing to a state bailout, saying that only its banks may need help.
"There's a global concern that if Ireland needs aid, it could become a domino effect with other countries," said Cort Gwon, director of trading strategies and research at FBN Securities in New York.
"Especially at such a sensitive time in the economy to have a setback in Europe could mean a setback for the rest of the world, too."
The premium investors demand to hold Irish government bonds rather than German benchmarks widened to 581.6 basis points from around 562 basis points at Monday's settlement.
The cost of insuring against debt default in Ireland, Portugal and Greece also crept higher, even as EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said Portugal's challenges were "very different" from those of Ireland.
World stocks fell 1.77 percent, according to the MSCI All-Country World Index .MIWD00000PUS. The index has lost about 4.0 percent since November 5 when it closed higher for the last time.
In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300
index of top shares ended down 2.3 percent at 1,086.61 points.
fell 178.47 points, or 1.59 percent, at 11,023.50, while The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
declined 19.41 points, or 1.62 percent, to 1,178.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index
sank 43.98 points, or 1.75 percent, to 2,469.84.
The euro slipped 0.77 percent to $1.3478 as anxiety about Ireland eclipsed a stronger-than-expected reading of German ZEW institute's economic sentiment index.
"What's the driving the euro is just all the sovereign risk out of Europe," said Jack Iles, a portfolio manager at MFC Global Investment Management in Boston. "That's driving sentiment across the board for risk assets and that probably will not go away in the next 48 hours."
The dollar gained 1.0 percent versus a basket of major currencies, according to the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar rose 0.28 percent to 83.36.
The reports increased expectations that China will further tighten monetary policy to help fight inflation. Commodity prices fell as a result, as China is one of the world's top consumers of raw materials.
U.S. crude oil prices lost 2.97 percent to $82.34 a barrel, the lowest close since October 29. Spot gold prices fell 1.47 percent to $1,338.90, notching their biggest three-day loss in nearly a year.
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries recovered from a dramatic two-day selloff and rose a full point in price, sending their yield down to 2.8418 percent.
Investors bought Treasuries again on news that core U.S. producer prices fell unexpectedly in October, supporting the case for the Federal Reserve's program of bond repurchases.
