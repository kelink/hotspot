(Reuters) - UCBH Holdings Inc UCBH.O said it would suspend dividend payments on its common and preferred stock and defer interest payments on its trust preferred securities, as part of its plan to strengthen capital.
The company expects to save about $46.2 million in annual cash payments and strengthen its Tier 1 capital ratio by about 15 basis points through these actions, UCBH said in a statement.
UCBH, which had a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 12.18 percent as of March 31, also engaged a financial adviser for its capital plans.
The company, which raised $298.7 million through the U.S. Treasury's capital purchase program in November, said it expects to complete its year-end 2008 financial restatement and file its first- and second-quarter 2009 results during the third quarter.
UCBH also said China Minsheng Banking Corp Ltd has agreed to extend its investment agreement until Dec. 31, allowing Minsheng to potentially increase its investment up to 20 percent.
Separately, Fitch Ratings cut the long-term issuer default ratings of UCBH Holdings and its bank subsidiary United Commercial Bank.
Given the company's financial pressures, it could be subject to regulatory action, which would potentially weaken the parent company's financial profile further, Fitch said in a statement.
"Beyond the potential China Minsheng investment, the prospects for raising equity from external sources is considered low given UCBH's credit challenges," Fitch said.
UCBH, which engaged three external loan review firms to reassess a majority of its loan portfolio, said about 80 percent of the loans reviewed had no delinquencies.
