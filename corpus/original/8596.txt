Rasmussen, speaking in an interview to Reuters in Moscow after meeting Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, said momentum was growing ahead of the conference.
"Convinced is probably too big a word, but I have decided to stay optimistic about this because I have been engaged in talks with many leaders in the last couple of months and I sense a very strong political willingness to conclude a result in Copenhagen," he said.
"Hopefully, I will be able to issue invitations for heads of state and government in a few weeks time," he said. "I really believe that they will participate if it's realistic that we could seal an ambitious deal in Copenhagen in December."
Developed nations say the poor must also do more by 2020 to slow their rising emissions. China, the United States, Russia and India are the top emitters.
