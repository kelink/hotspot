Brent scales $99 before expiry, U.S. oil rises

(Reuters) - Brent crude rose above $99 a barrel on Friday, failing to reach $100 before the front-month contract expired, but helping lift U.S. oil prices despite China's latest move to tighten credit.
The strength of U.S. equities and Brent helped U.S. crude end higher after seesawing and being pressured early by China's move to lift lenders' reserve rate requirements by 50 basis points in its ongoing effort to tame inflation.
ICE Brent futures have traded above U.S. crude since August last year, supported by a combination of dwindling North Sea crude supplies and disruption of oil grades priced off it, traders said.
In London, expiring ICE Brent crude for February settled at $98.68, up 62 cents, the highest close since the September 26, 2008, close at $103.54, and reaching $99.20 intraday, the highest front-month price since Brent hit $100.31 intraday on October 1, 2008.
The week's 5.73 percent rise was best weekly percentage rise for Brent since the week to December 3, 2010.
New front-month March Brent settled at $98.38, up $1.09, trading as high as $98.75.
U.S. crude oil for February delivery rose 14 cents, or 0.05 percent, to settle at $91.54 a barrel, in choppy trading having bounced off a $90.10 low.
Rising gasoline prices pushed down U.S. consumer sentiment in early January, overshadowing an improved job outlook and passage of temporary federal tax breaks, a Thomson Reuters and the University of Michigan survey released on Friday showed.
Stronger-than-expected earnings from JPMorgan Chase & Co lifted the stock market, offsetting lukewarm economic data and helping S&P 500 to its seventh straight week of gains. .N
"Equities and oil seem a bit toppy, and U.S. crude hasn't been able to push to far above $92, but if you get a $100 Brent print then U.S. crude should take off," said Richard Ilczyszyn, senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago.
A separate report showed December U.S. retail sales rose slightly less than expected, though total 2010 sales reversed two years of contraction with the biggest gain in more than a decade.
Early on Friday, U.S. oil and other commodities felt pressure from the China reserve requirement hike.
China's recent tightening policy has prompted worries that Beijing's appetite for buying oil and other commodities could decrease.
The discount for U.S. crude futures' benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) against Brent reached fresh 23-month highs over $8 a barrel, the widest discount since February 2009.
February Brent's approaching expiration had analysts expecting it to erode some of the strong differential, as February had been trading at a premium to March. But that was before the March contract's strong performance on Friday, which narrowed the deficit to February to 30 cents.
Trading volumes were robust ahead of Monday's U.S. Martin Luther King Day holiday that will shut open outcry trading for U.S. crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange, though electronic trading for Tuesday trade date will be available.
