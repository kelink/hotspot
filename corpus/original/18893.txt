(Reuters) - Nepal's Prime Minister Prachanda has quit in a crisis over his sacking of the army chief, plunging the Himalayan republic into political turmoil.
* Mountainous Nepal, tucked in the Himalayas between China and India, occupies an area of 147,000 sq km (57,000 sq miles) and has a population of nearly 27 million. It is home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountains, including Mount Everest.
* Nepal became into a republic in May last year after a specially elected assembly abolished the 239-year-old monarchy. The kings were traditionally considered incarnations of the god Vishnu, one of the trinity of Hindu gods.
* The last king, Gyanendra, grabbed absolute power in early 2005. He was forced from power after street protests the following year.
* Eighty percent of Nepalis are Hindu, with the rest Buddhist, Muslim or Christian.
* Nepal is one of the world's poorest countries and its economy depends on aid and tourism -- international aid comprises more than 30 percent of the annual budget. One quarter of its people still live on a daily income of less than a dollar.
* More than 80 percent of the population earns its livelihood from agriculture. Emerging from a decade-long civil war, the economy grew by just 2.3 percent in the fiscal year ending mid-July 2007, down from 3.1 percent the year before. More recent figures were not immediately available.
