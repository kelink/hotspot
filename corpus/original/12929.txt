UPDATE 2-Chile June industry output down but above forecast

(Reuters) - Chilean industrial production fell for the ninth consecutive month but beat market expectations, signaling a softer landing of the economy as the government sees a recovery from the crisis in the second half of the year.
June's industrial output fell 8.3 percent from the same month a year earlier, the government said on Thursday, a percentage point lower than the 9.9 percent decrease analysts and economists polled by Reuters expected.
"It's a bit better than expected and it signals that the sector is slowly stabilizing," said Alvise Marino, an analyst with IDEAglobal in New York. "We hit bottom on that front... the fact that we see signs of stabilization in Brazil and China is a very positive factor for industrial production."
Chile, considered one of Latin America's most stable economies, has been hit hard by the global financial meltdown, spiking unemployment and curtailing the price of its chief export, copper.
Still, top government and central bank officials see a healthier economy in the second half of the year as copper prices recover and the $4 billion fiscal stimulus package and record low central bank rates start to help businesses.
In June 2008, industrial output, which was led by exports of copper, salmon and cellulose, fell 0.9 percent, while in May 2009 it plunged 10.5 percent.
Chile, which mines about a third of the world's copper, produced 467,185 tonnes of the metal in June, down 2.6 percent from the same month last year, the government said.
While the South American country's jobless rate for the April-to-June period was 10.7 percent, above the 10.2 percent rate in the March-to-May period reported last month, official data showed. The market expected a 10.6 percent unemployment in the April-June period, according to a Reuters poll. (Additional reporting by Alonso Soto) (Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
