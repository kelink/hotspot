(Reuters) - British health services firm Synergy Health Plc (
) posted a higher first-half profit, aided by growing patient-safety requirements in hospitals, and said it expected the trend to continue in the second half.
The company, whose services include sterilisation of medical equipment for hospitals, said it was comfortable with the market forecast for the year ending March 28, 2010, helped by growth in China.
"We are slightly ahead of expectations in the first half and are comfortable with how the business is performing currently," Chief Executive Richard Steeves told Reuters.
Synergy might consider acquisitions in China, ramp up investments in Malaysia and Thailand and explore markets in Cambodia, South Korea and Vietnam, Steeves said.
"The fastest-growing market for us is Asia and specifically China," he said.
While contracts already secured in China will add 1 million pounds in annual revenue, addition of more hospitals to the network could further boost revenue in fiscal 2011, he said.
Synergy was likely to look for Jacques's successor outside the company and had already begun the search, CEO Steeves said.
RISING PROFIT, HIGHER DIVIDEND
During the six months ended Sept. 27, the company earned 14.9 million pounds before taxes, amortisation and non-recurring items, compared with 12.4 million pounds in the year-ago period.
Synergy, which had slowed down growth in the UK to deal with falling margins, said it recently began reinvesting in marketing facilities and forecast a slight improvement in organic growth in the region in fiscal 2011.
