(Reuters) - China's Ping An Insurance (
), the world's No. 2 life insurer by market value, swung to a quarterly profit as a recovery in markets since last year boosted investment returns.
Net profit in the July-September quarter was 2.58 billion yuan ($378 million), against a previously reported loss of 7.88 billion yuan a year earlier, based on a report issued through the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
China's stock market
, in which Ping An puts a portion of its investments, rallied in the first half of the year. It then shed 6 percent in the third quarter as investors worried about a possible tightening of monetary policy after a surge in lending and government-led investment.
Ping An's shares fell 0.97 percent to HK$71.4 in Hong Kong on Tuesday ahead of the results. The stock has nearly doubled so far this year, outperforming a 60 percent gain in the benchmark Hang Seng Index
