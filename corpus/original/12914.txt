The Calgary, Alberta-based company makes proteins that it fuses with genes from safflower seed oil to make insulin, a hormone used in treating diabetes.
"(The patent) consolidates their position in the insulin manufacturing space," said Versant Partners analyst Douglas Loe.
"It allows them to exclude others from using their preferred crop plant of choice, safflower, for producing insulin for medical markets."
SemBioSys was granted a European patent last year and patents are pending in Canada, Australia, Japan, China, India and Mexico.
The trial was "reasonably positive" and SemBioSys's insulin is likely "three to four years away from commercialization, best case scenario," Loe said.
"Human insulin is currently the world's largest-volume protein pharmaceutical and is an ideal target for our oil body-oleosin technology platform," James Szarko, chief executive of SemBioSys, said in a release.
SemBioSys Genetics Inc shares were up 16 Canadian cents, or 59.2 percent, at C$0.43 on the Toronto Stock Exchange at midday on Thursday. Earlier in the day the stock rose as high as 47 cents, up 74.07 percent.
"The next milestone will be to partner with a cash contributing firm in the diabetes space and to drive the program through Phase 3 clinical testing and to approval," Loe said.
