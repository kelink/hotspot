* Shares down 10 pct (Recasts, adds background, conference call details)
) posted first-quarter profit that missed market expectations, hurt by a drop in fertilizer prices, and guided lower revenue for 2010, sending its shares down 10 percent.
Analysts were expecting the company to report revenue of C$340.9 million, according to Reuters Estimates.
"In the first half of the year, like all companies related to the potash industry, we saw demand and prices decline from the very high levels experienced in 2008," Chief Executive Liu Guocai said in a statement.
Fertilizer companies posted record results a year ago, but the credit crunch, coupled with a collapse in commodity prices and a slump in fertilizer demand, has led to a drastic change in conditions for the industry over the past year.
Potash, nitrogen and phosphate are the three main macro nutrients used by farmers across the globe.
For the first quarter ended June 30, the company's net income was C$9.6 million, or 20 Canadian cents a share, compared with C$6.8 million, or 15 Canadian cents a share, a year ago.
Analysts on average were expecting the company to earn 22 Canadian cents a share, excluding items, on revenue of C$66.2 million, according to Reuters Estimates.
However, the company said its revenue dropped 30 percent from the previous quarter due to maintenance shutdowns, slightly lower selling prices and a stronger Canadian dollar.
Shares of the company were trading down 77 Canadian cents at C$7.00 in afternoon trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Sakshi A Mattoo in Bangalore; Editing by Aradhana Aravindan and Anil D'Silva)
