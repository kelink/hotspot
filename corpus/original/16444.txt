(Reuters) - China's Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Co, a machinery maker based in western China, may shift some Hummer production to China, state media reported on Tuesday.
Tengzhong is in talks to buy Hummer from bankrupt U.S. automaker General Motors Corp GMGMQ.PK and has previously said it intends to keep Hummer operations largely intact, including its suppliers, dealer networks and management. [ID:nN02495245]
"In the future, it's very likely (for us) to build up a Hummer production base in China," Yang Yi, Tengzhong's general manager was quoted saying by state-run China Central Television.
He said, however, the company would not seek to change Hummer's production in the United States for the time being.
The Sichuan-based heavy machinery maker will not take on any of Hummer's debt, Yang said. "This acquisition will not undertake any debts. They bear no relations to the new Hummer and Tengzhong Heavy Machinery," he said.
Tengzhong has the capability to purchase major U.S. brands at current low prices, he said, without saying how the company will finance the deal. He said Hummer will develop a new power system in order to the improve the fuel efficiency of its gas-guzzling vehicles. (Reporting by Michael Wei; Editing by David Holmes)
