(Reuters) - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch's head of Southeast Asia corporate and investment banking has left the firm, in a move that may hurt the firm's pipeline of deals in Indonesia, sources with knowledge of his departure told Reuters on Tuesday.
Roger Suyama, Merrill's point man for Indonesian mergers and acquisitions, left the company for personal reasons and is going back to the United States, one of the sources said.
BofA-Merrill Lynch declined comment, while Suyama was not available for comment. Messages sent to his company email address bounced back.
Suyama's departure will be a blow to Merrill as the banker was overseeing a number of deals such as the planned sale of Indonesian mining services company BUMA, which is also known as PT Bukit Makmur Mandiri Utama, sources said.
Merrill is also advising Indonesian businessman Rizal Risjad on the sale of his firm's majority stake in coal-miner PT Berau in a deal that could value the firm at around $1 billion. [nHKG137538]
Merrill's China Investment Banking Chairman Margaret Ren, a star China banker and relative of a former Chinese premier, left the bank in May, sources told Reuters. [nHKG373123].
Both Suyama and Ren were part of a team that Merrill had formed in 2007 to provide investment advice and investment banking services to the region's growing ranks of rich entrepreneurs. (Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)
