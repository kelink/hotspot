(Reuters) - India's top two cement firms beat expectations with quarterly profit rising by up to 23 percent and analysts forecast the growth would be maintained in the near term on strong rural demand and large constructions.
Falling prices of raw materials such as coal and lower transport costs should help cement makers in India, the world's largest market for the commodity after China, in April-June but large new capacity could weigh in later quarters, analysts said.
Producers will also be helped by a 2-3 percent increase in cement prices effected in March, they said.

Earlier this year, ACC forecast cement demand in 2009 would rise between 6-8 percent, lower than the 9.3 percent growth over the past five years, as a slowing Indian economy hit demand from housing and construction industries.
But India's 207-million-tonne capacity cement sector has seen demand reviving in the past few months, benefiting from surprising resilience in rural consumption and higher government spending on roads, highways and irrigation projects.
"April-June could be better as costs come down further and demand stays strong. But we need to see if this can be sustainable beyond the monsoon," said Rajan Kumar, sector analyst at Centrum Broking.
Nearly 50 million tonnes of new capacity is scheduled to become operational by March 2010, which analysts feel could narrow margins later this year. ($1 = 50.3 rupees) (Editing by Ranjit Gangadharan)
