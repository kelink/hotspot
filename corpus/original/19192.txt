FACTBOX-China's economic recovery: optimism and a few doubts
2009-04-30 04:58:00.0
(Reuters) - Green shoots of recovery have sprouted throughout China thanks to the government's stimulus package, but the economy is still far from being in full bloom.
-- China's GDP grew 6.1 percent in the first three months compared with the same period a year earlier, its weakest quarter on record. But on a quarter-on-quarter basis the economy recovered briskly after nearly stalling at the end of last year.
-- Capital spending has accelerated on the back of the government's 4 trillion yuan stimulus package. Annual growth in investment in fixed assets from roads to power plants surged unexpectedly to 28.6 percent in the first three months.
-- China's banks made 4.58 trillion yuan of new loans in the first quarter, nearly meeting the government's minimum full-year target. In stark contrast to the credit crunch elsewhere in the world, big Chinese companies are flush with cash and Beijing's investment plans have ample funding. [ID:nPEK70022]
-- After being perhaps the biggest domestic drag on growth last year, property investment is gradually speeding up as house prices stop falling and transaction volumes rise.
-- A wide range of U.S. companies, from construction equipment maker Caterpillar (
), point to China as the bright spot in a grim global market. [ID:nN26463548]
-- Miners are the biggest gainers in European stock markets this year, up about 20 percent, buoyed by Chinese buying. Copper has rallied as China stockpiles the metal. [ID:nLS802283]
-- Chinese exports have fallen for five straight months and, though the rate of decline seems to be easing, the weakness has battered once-roaring coastal factories and eliminated millions of blue-collar jobs. [ID:nPEK326020]
-- Investment growth has been driven almost exclusively by public spending and officials have expressed concern at the private sector's sluggish response to the stimulus plan. [ID:nPEK1881164]
-- Chinese industrial firms' profits fell nearly 40 percent in the first two months of 2009 compared with a year earlier.
Its surge earlier in the year foreshadowed the broader economic rebound, raising concerns that the petering out of the rally could point to a bumpier road ahead with confidence still fragile. (Reporting by Simon Rabinovitch; Editing by Alan Wheatley)
