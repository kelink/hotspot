The new rules, which were published on CSRC's website to solicit public opinion, are aimed at "letting new shares reflect the actual value of companies, fostering balanced and healthy development of both the primary and thesecondarymarkets as well as protecting investors' interest".
CSRC's chairman, Guo Shuqing, has taken a series of measures to improve the mechanism and transparency of a volatile stock market
In March China's two stock exchanges strengthened rules to guard against excessive volatility in newly-listed shares.
Chinese IPOs have traditionally been the focus of market speculation with the prices of many new stock listings showing big swings during their first days of trading, especially on the smaller Shenzhen market, where more small-cap firms are listed.
For example, of the 583 stocks that debuted in Shenzhen between early 2010 and end-February this year, 497 now trade below their initial prices, including 33 that more than doubled on the first day of trading.
The draft rules will also allow underwriters to select five to 10 experienced individual investors to participate in a so-called "off-line" portion of the IPO subscription, which has typically been reserved for institutional investors only.
