(Reuters) - State-run Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) 5110.SE has invited bidders for a 2,000 megawatt power plant project in Riyadh as part of efforts to meet soaring demand, a senior company official said on Saturday.
The combined cycle plant project in the Saudi capital will start its first phase of operation by 2012, Amr Aswaha, head of projects for independent power projects (IPP), told Reuters.
Bidding ends in December with a decision expected in March 2010, he added, without giving details.
