(Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund has no specific plans to review Argentina's economy, a spokeswoman for the Fund said on Thursday.
A review would help pave the way for Argentina to return to global debt markets. IMF economic reviews, known as Article IV consultations, are typically conducted annually in each of the Fund's 186 member countries, although Argentina has refused to have one in more than three years.
"We're ready and open to have an Article IV consultation," IMF spokeswoman Caroline Atkinson said at a media briefing. "We have not received any specific request, and we have no specific plans for an Article IV with Argentina at the present."
Atkinson also said IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn would travel to Singapore and China following this weekend's Group of 20 meeting in Scotland.
Strauss-Kahn is scheduled to be in Singapore on Nov. 13, where he will give a speech on Asia's role in reshaping the global economy.
His visit to China Nov. 16-17 is expected to include discussions with Chinese authorities on the international policy response to the financial crisis and Asia's role in the recovery, she said.
China's swift response to the financial crisis has been credited with helping to lift the global economy from the depths of a recession. The United States has been pushing to give Beijing more clout in the global economy, commensurate with its growing role, including more influence within the IMF.
