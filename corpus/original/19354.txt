), Allianz (
) and Fortis FOR.BR overall forecast a doubling of their client base and assets under management over the next three years, a survey by PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) [PWC.UL] showed.

"Some of China's massive bank savings will definitely find their way into capital markets, which provide better returns in the long run," PwC partner Alex Wong said in Shanghai.
"Despite the global financial crisis, there has been no change in the foreign commitment to China."
So far, 32 foreign institutions including American International Group (
), AXA (
) have entered China's 2 trillion yuan fund-management industry, which is crowded with 60 players.

Domestic fund house China Asset Management Co is the country's biggest fund manager with 200 billion yuan under management, representing a 10 percent market share.
