China to crank up credit as lending, economy slow

(Reuters) - China's central bank cut the amount of cash banks must hold in reserves on Saturday, boosting lending capacity by an estimated 350-400 billion yuan ($55.6-$63.5 billion) in a bid to crank up credit creation as the world's second-biggest economy faces a fifth successive quarter of slowing growth.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) is on the course of gentle policy easing to cushion the world's fastest-growing major economy against stiff global headwinds as Europe's debt crisis grinds on, although it has been treading warily.
The PBOC cut big banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 50 basis points to 20.5 percent, effective from next Friday, after repeatedly defying market expectations for such a move after it first cut the ratio last November.
"It's not a big surprise. Although they (Chinese leaders) stress policy stability, an RRR cut is necessary. Trade and monetary data in January pointed to some downward pressure on the economy," said Hua Zhongwei, an economist at Huachuang Securities in Beijing.
China's economy is likely to slow to an annual growth rate of 8.2 percent in the first quarter from 8.9 percent in the previous quarter, according to the latest Reuters poll.
Data for January came in below market expectations, with exports contracting 0.5 percent from a year earlier and money supply growth falling to 12.4 percent from the previous month's 13.6 percent, which analysts said argued for more easing.
"The growth implications of the below-normal lending in January are dire, should that lending pace be continued," said Paul Markowski, President of New York-based MES Advisers, a long-time investment adviser to China's monetary authorities, who calculates lending was on a 7.9 percent growth path.
"The implication of that is sub-7 percent GDP growth for the year -- a real recession," he said.
Economists broadly believe China's economy needs to grow at around 8 percent a year to absorb the annual influx of new entrants to the workforce and rural migrants leaving the land to find jobs in the country's vast factory sector.
China's leader-in-waiting, Xi Jinpeng, assured an audience of business executives on Los Angeles on Friday that China's growth would not falter it would continue to rebalance its economy to import more from other countries.
"There will be no so-called hard landing," said Xi, who is almost sure to succeed Hu Jintao as Chinese president in just over a year, on the final day of his tour of the United States.
The central bank announced its first cut in RRR in three years on November 30, 2011, taking the rate down by 50 bps.
Investors had expected another RRR cut ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year in late January, but they were wrong-footed as the central bank opted for open market operations to provide short-term cash for banks.
Few analysts believe the central bank will cut interest rates outright this year, with annual inflation staying stubbornly higher than the one-year deposit rate of 3.5 percent.
With annual consumer inflation having ticked back up to 4.5 percent in January from 4.1 percent in December, after averaging more than 5 percent through 2011 versus the government's 4 percent target, the PBOC is expected to remain cautious about aggressive monetary easing in the near term.
"We still see four more RRR cuts in the remainder of the year," said Shen Lan, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank in Shanghai. "The central bank may still stress policy stability. The next cut should be in Q2."
In addition, the PBOC has conducted a series of reverse repos to inject cash into the banking system.
Policymakers are determined to avoid another speculative bubble, such as the one in real estate that they have struggled for two years to adequately cool, gaining real traction only in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Average home prices fell by 0.2 percent in January from December, the fourth straight month of falls, according to a Reuters weighted average index based on official data released on Saturday.
Rather than take big steps to loosen monetary conditions, the PBOC has gradually relaxed some controls on credit at smaller regional institutions in recent months to support the slowing economy.
That has dovetailed with the central bank's tweaking policies meant to contain property speculation, by ordering banks to support first-time home buyers, as home prices have continued to fall.
"It's hard to predict the exact timing of a cut, but policy loosening will continue as inflation eases," said Wang Hu, an economist at Guotai Junan Securities in Shanghai.

WRONG!! Credit is evil. China is on its first steps to social depravity and economic collapse. I knew they would screw up one time or another.

China¡¯s 12th Five Year Plan (2011-2015) calls for development of the central and western provinces. 46 million low cost housing units (10 million in 2011 and 9 million per year to 2015) were added along with an environmental improvement plan for the Durban Conference in 2011. China intended to lower GDP growth to 9% in 2011 but natural disasters in Australia, Japan, South Korea, and other trading partners forced China to raise production to 9.25% GDP growth. In addition, China planned to reduce its 2011 trade surplus by 20% but damaged nations needed more goods, so the surplus fell only 14.5%. China exceeded all of its planned numbers. China reduced the housing bubble gradually by restricting the numbers of homes speculators could buy to 1, 2, or 3 in 70 cities in China and by adding construction of 10 million low cost housing units, enough for 30 million Chinese. 36 million more will be added over 4 years to house 138 million people or 10% of China¡¯s population. This has caused a gradual reduction in home prices. While China builds airports, railroads, roads, power plants, shops, factories, shopping centers, schools, and hospitals, the new infrastructure is not producing products, but China will make new products in future years. Also, the workers are receiving jobs with paychecks to become customers and taxpayers. New businesses cater to the construction workers, and they will sell to new workers when the factories and shops make products to be transported by transport workers to shopping centers for salesmen to sell the customers who are transported or who drive in the world¡¯s biggest car market. China will continue to grow around 9% per year despite economic problems in the US and EU.
