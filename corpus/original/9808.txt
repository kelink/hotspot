(Reuters) - PGG Wrightson Ltd (
), New Zealand's biggest rural services company, has sold a 13 percent stake to China-based Agria Corp (
), gaining a foothold in the huge Chinese market and sending its shares up nearly 40 percent.
PGG Wrightson, which came close to breaking banking covenants earlier this year after struggling with debt, also said on Friday it would raise NZ$36 million ($26.7 million) from the deal.
The deal covered joint ventures in a range of agricultural services, such as product research in seeds and livestock, and the development of a rural services business in China.
"PGG Wrightson has for some time been looking to establish a strategy and business platform into China," Chairman Keith Smith said.
Agria would become a cornerstone shareholder through an issue of shares at NZ$0.88 cents each. PGG Wrightson shares, which had traded at NZ$0.65 prior to being halted pending the announcement, leapt as high as NZ$0.90 and were last trading at NZ$0.82. At its full year results on Aug 27, PGG Wrightson said it was looking at possible asset sales and equity raising, after being close to breaching its banking covenants at the end of the financial year to June 30. It reported a full year loss for the year of NZ$66.4 million.
PGG Wrightson said it is also looking at an equity raising separate from the placement to Agria, and any announcement would be made by early November.
Agria Corp's business is centred on research and development of a range of agricultural products.
Agria's shares closed on Thursday at $2.19, having gained 29.5 percent so far this year. ($1=NZ$1.35) (Reporting by Adrian Bathgate)
