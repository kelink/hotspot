(Reuters) - Tobacco use will kill 6 million people next year from cancer, heart disease, emphysema and a range of other ills, the American Cancer Society said in a report issued on Tuesday.
The society's new Tobacco Atlas estimates that tobacco use costs the global economy $500 billion a year in direct medical expenses, lost productivity and environmental harm.
"Tobacco's total economic costs reduce national wealth in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) by as much as 3.6 percent," the report reads.
"Tobacco accounts for one out of every 10 deaths worldwide and will claim 5.5 million lives this year alone," the report said. If current trends hold, by 2020, the number will grown to an estimated 7 million and top 8 million by 2030.
Over the past four decades, smoking rates have declined in rich countries like the United States, Britain and Japan while rising in much of the developing world, according to the nonprofit research and advocacy organization.
Some other findings from the report, available at
* Smoking rates among women are either stable or increasing in several southern, central and eastern European countries.
* Nearly 60 percent of Chinese men smoke and China consumes more than 37 percent of the world's cigarettes.
* 50 million Chinese children, mostly boys, will die prematurely from tobacco-related diseases.
* Tobacco use will eventually kill 250 million of today's teenagers and children.
* Occupational exposure to secondhand smoke kills 200,000 workers every year.
"One hundred million people were killed by tobacco in the 20th century. Unless effective measures are implemented to prevent young people from smoking and to help current smokers quit, tobacco will kill 1 billion people in the 21st century," the report predicts.
