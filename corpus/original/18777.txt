(Reuters) - An aircraft carrying 98 Chinese stranded in Mexico by the H1N1 flu scare arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday and all on board appear healthy though they will have to spend a week in quarantine, state media said.
The China Southern flight, which had been delayed by bad weather, came to a halt away from the main terminal building where officials in white protective clothing and masks waited to lead passengers on to a fleet of buses.
They were to be taken to a hotel near the airport for seven days of quarantined medical observation, state television said.
The crew will also be quarantined, though they have the choice of staying in Shanghai or the southern city of Guangzhou, the airline's home base, it said.
None of the 43 Mexicans that Beijing quarantined had shown symptoms of the H1N1 flu virus, prompting Mexico to accuse China of being "discriminatory."
China denied the charge, saying isolation was the correct procedure.
The row has strained what had been a warming relationship but, with Beijing courting Latin America as a trade and diplomatic partner, the damage appears unlikely to last.
Mexico is considered the epicenter of the flu outbreak, which has infected more than 1,490 people in 21 countries, sparking fears of a global pandemic.
The Chinese quarantines came after a Mexican man fell ill with the flu in Hong Kong, having arrived from Mexico via Shanghai.
