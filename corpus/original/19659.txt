(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (
) sees India as one of its key markets and is committed to its planned investment of $250 million announced last year, a company official said on Friday.
) are increasingly relying on developing markets like China, India and Russia for growth, as North American sales of traditional soft drinks have slowed amid a growing consumer emphasis on health and an economic slowdown.
"India is a strategic market. We have our investment plans, which are intact," Atul Singh, president for Coca-Cola's India and Southwest Asia business unit, told reporters.
"All our investments are on track. We have added more bottle lines, we have added trucks, we have added cold equipment," he said. "We continue to invest in all the brands that we market."
Coca-Cola, which gets bulk of its revenue from abroad, saw its India sales volume rise 31 percent in its fiscal first quarter to April 3, leading its international sales growth, while China grew 10 percent.
"Our investments have been in infrastructure, people, cold drink equipment, and behind brands... we have trained lot of people, retailers, distributors, salesmen," Singh said.
"Whatever will be needed, we will do."
Coca-Cola sells drinks including Diet Coke, Thums Up, Fanta, Limca, and Georgia in India, the world's second-most populous country, and growth in the market is important for the firm at a time when it is facing roadblocks in its China expansion.
In March, China blocked Coca-Cola's planned $2.4 billion takeover of the country's top juice maker, Huiyuan (
), saying the deal would have been bad for competition.
PepsiCo has also invested $700 million in India and Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said last September $500 million more would be spent over three years to beef up operations with an aim to triple revenue from the country. (Writing by Devidutta Tripathy; Editing by John Mair)
