METALS-Copper rallies into the close as dollar slides

(Reuters) - Copper surged to its highest level in over a month on Monday, with strong investment money flows into the complex as the dollar held near 14-month lows against the euro and talk about an end to consumer destocking feeding through to the price surge.
"It's running on the money flow and outside market influences," said Bill O'Neill, partner of LOGIC Advisors in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, citing the ongoing struggles in the U.S. dollar as the main catalyst.
"When it comes to the dollar, there is a general feeling that it's going to continue to go in the same direction and that is providing the underlying support."
Copper for December delivery HGZ9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division shot up 12.10 cents, or 4.3 percent, to end at $2.9665 a lb. The day's range was $2.8055 to $2.9690, its highest level since Sept. 9.
On the London Metal Exchange (LME), benchmark copper MCU3 closed up $225 at $6,465 a tonne. In after-hours trade, the metal used in power and construction climbed to $6,510, another high dating back to early Sept.
Analysts say talk over the last few days -- during LME Week -- that consumers may have used up their stocks had boosted sentiment in the industrial metals market, which for some weeks now has been looking for direction.
"Generally just firmer across the board," said Edward Meir, energy and metals analyst for MF Global in New York. "On the whole the (LME Week) mood was fairly constructive ... (Consumer stocks) are low and is not much of a cushion going into next year.
"The feeling is short-term very overbought but next year people are cautiously optimistic -- China is very much still a growth story, the dollar is weak, fund flows are coming back," he added.
Further support stemmed from the supply-side, where Peruvian miners held a nationwide strike [ID:nN19359574], while a strike last week at Chile's Spence copper mine caused the BHP Billiton (
Both gave investors clues on future industry labor talks, said MF Global's Meir. He added that although the strike action was offering some price support, high inventory levels suggested this was limited at present.
"Inventories aren't coming down, so they are still not at a choke point yet and not really pinching the supply chain," Meir said.
Copper stockpiles in LME warehouses stand above 356,000 tonnes, up about 40 percent since the middle of July. <LME/STX1>
Aluminum closed at $1,945 a tonne from $1,905 on Friday. The metal used in transport and packaging has in recent months been supported by financing deals which have tied up about 70 percent of LME stocks until May 2010. [ID:nLL175677]
"(The risk to aluminum prices is) financing deals are broken and more metal becomes available," BofA Merrill Lynch said in a note. "Smelters will need to show production restraint in the coming years to restore a degree of normality on the aluminum market."
Steel ingredient nickel MNI3 ended at $19,275 from $18,700 on Friday, lead MPB3 was untraded in LME rings, but last bid at $2,288 from $2,204 a tonne and zinc MZN3 at $2,112 from $2,053.
"On the 'standard fundamentals' of demand, supply and inventory, the LME Week consensus was that the world would not be short of aluminum, nickel, zinc or lead in a hurry," Citi said in a note.
Tin MSN3 was untraded in LME rings, last bid at $14,550 from $14,550 on Friday. In electronic trade, prices headed up to a late high of $14,800.
That is reflected in the premium for cash material over the three-month contract, which at around $400 a tonne is down from $730 on Sept. 22, but it is still nearly double the levels seen at the end of August.
