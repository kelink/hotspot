METALS-Copper hits 1-week high on strong US housing data

(Reuters) - Copper hit a one-week high on Friday, rallying more than 5 percent as strong U.S. housing data boosted many investors' outlook for demand.
Copper rallied in tandem with U.S. equities and crude oil. Both markets raced up to their 2009 peaks on positive comments about global growth from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and data showing existing home sales rose for the fourth month in a row, suggesting positive demand prospects.

Copper for three-months delivery MCU3 on the London Metal Exchange closed at $6,270 a tonne versus $6,049 on Thursday. In late after hours trade, it had moved to its highest since Aug. 14 at $6,335 a tonne, rallying with other markets.
In New York, copper for September delivery HGU9 settled 13.90 cent, or 5.07 percent, higher at $2.8805 a lb on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division, near the one-week peak at $2.8835 hit earlier. That level was last seen on Aug. 14 when copper reached a 10-1/2-month top.

"Existing home sales and the Bernanke speech came out simultaneously. Both Bernanke and home sales were 'all aboard' the recovery story," said Alan Ruskin, Global Head of Currency Strategy at RBS Global Banking and Markets in Connecticut.
At an annual Federal Reserve conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Bernanke gave his clearest signal yet that a recovery is at hand, though he cautioned that growth would be sluggish for awhile. [ID:nN2139655]
Just the same, metals investors saw the twin messages of improving recovery prospects having potential to boost demand.
"This is all very constructive because the market needs to see data not coming in line (with) or barely beating estimates," said Edward Meir, an analyst at MF Global. "People are pushing prices higher because of what they perceive to be a pick-up in demand -- the question is how strong that will be."
Meir added that while the downturn had bottomed out and was in recovery mode, a price correction could not be ruled out.
A weak U.S. currency, which makes metals priced in dollars less expensive for holders of other currencies, also supported prices, analysts said. [USD/]

"We believe China's aluminium production is ramping up again. In addition, China's stockpiles of aluminium are significant," Citigroup Global Markets said in a note.
