US sends Guantanamo detainee to Afghanistan

(Reuters) - The Obama administration freed a detainee from the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on Monday and sent him home to Afghanistan, part of its pledge to close the controversial prison in five months.
Mohammed Jawad was accused of throwing a grenade that wounded two U.S. soldiers and their interpreter in Kabul in 2002. After returning home, he was reunited with his family in Kabul, said Air Force Major David Frakt, one of his lawyers.
Upon arrival in Afghanistan, authorities moved to detain him but another one of his lawyers reminded them that he was to be freed, Frakt said. Jawad later met President Hamid Karzai and was reunited with his family, he said.
Jawad is the 12th detainee to be released since President Barack Obama pledged on Jan. 20, the day he took office, to close the prison within a year. Some lawmakers question whether he can deal with the remaining 228 prisoners by then.
Separately, a U.S. judge on Monday refused a request for freedom from Kuwaiti detainee Fawzi al-Odah. Seven detainees have had their requests denied and 29 have been granted by the U.S. District Court in Washington.
In June, three detainees were sent to Saudi Arabia, one went home to Chad and another to Iraq. Four Chinese Muslim Uighurs held at Guantanamo were resettled in June in Bermuda because they feared persecution back home in China.
Jawad's situation was especially difficult for the Obama administration not only because of his age but also because much of the evidence was thrown out when two judges said it was obtained through torture.
In July, Judge Ellen Huvelle ordered him released from Guantanamo, where he had been held for more than six years.
U.S. Justice Department officials had said they were considering prosecuting Jawad in U.S. federal court, but no charges were filed. (Editing by Howard Goller)
