(Reuters) - U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Jim Steinberg will lead a U.S. delegation to Asia to consult regional players on how to respond to North Korea's latest nuclear test, U.S. officials said on Thursday.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said U.S. Ambassador Stephen Bosworth, the U.S. special envoy on North Korea, was expected to accompany Steinberg on the planned journey to Japan, China, Russia and South Korea.
The officials ruled out the possibility of the delegation visiting North Korea, which has been condemned internationally since conducting a nuclear test on Monday, its second in two and a half years.
"Deputy Secretary Steinberg plans to lead an inter-agency delegation to the region to consult with our five-party partners on next steps to respond to North Korea's defiance of the international community," Kelly said, providing no other details.
Pyongyang had agreed to take steps to give up its nuclear ambitions under so-called six-party talks that include the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States. The "five-party partners" refers to all except North Korea.
But this week's test has reinforced a belief among U.S. officials that the Communist-ruled Asian nation is intent on keeping its nuclear capability despite a 2005 disarmament-for-aid deal in which it agreed to abandon all its nuclear programs.
In addition to the possibility that a nuclear-armed North Korea could directly threaten U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, where 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed, it could also trigger an arms race in northeast Asia.
Earlier, the State Department said Steinberg was traveling to Singapore from Friday to Sunday and to Japan from Sunday to Tuesday on a previously scheduled trip.
