) in China resumed work on Sunday, ending a three-day strike over pay and benefits, state media said.
The strike, at Toyota-affiliated parts maker Toyoda Gosei Co (
), had forced a stoppage for most of Friday at the Japanese car makers' joint venture factory in the northern city of Tianjin, near to Beijing.
China has been hit by a rash of strikes at factories across the country over the past few weeks, mainly over pay.
The wage rises demanded by the factories would add little to the cost of products made in China, meaning the country's role as a manufacturing base appears secure. But the outbreak of worker unrest presents a tricky challenge for China's ruling Communist Party, which has vowed to improve workers' incomes but is jittery about any protests.
Toyota said on Saturday its Tianjin factory, held jointly with Chinese carmaker FAW (
), would resume output on Monday.
Workers at Toyoda Gosei reached a deal late in the afternoon on Saturday and went back to work on Sunday morning, China's state-run news agency Xinhua said.
Xinhua said the more than 1,300 workers at the plant earned an average of about 1,500 yuan a month.
"I'm not sure the back-to-work thing is temporary or that all of us have already totally accepted (the) offer," the report quoted Zhao as saying.
