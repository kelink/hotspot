(Reuters) - Global sales of sports equipment, apparel and footwear were flat at $284 billion last year as the recession hit developed countries, according to a study released on Wednesday.
While sales were up 4 percent in Asia and 7 percent in the Middle East and Africa, that was offset by a 1 percent decline in both the Americas and Europe, including a drop of 2 percent in the United States, according to research firm NPD Group. In 2007, sales rose 4 percent globally.
"Clearly, in Japan, the U.S. and Western Europe, the sports market underperformed relative to the economy," NPD analyst Renaud Vaschalde said in a statement.
Sales in China surged for the second straight year, up 15 percent in 2008 due to such factors as a growing middle class with more disposable income and the presence of the Beijing Olympic Games, he said.
However, NPD said the strong growth in China may hit a wall this year due to the global recession.
NPD reported positive results last year in the market for running, walking/hiking, cycling, training/fitness and soccer, as those sports are easy to pursue and family-friendly.
Golf, basketball, tennis, and hunting and fishing lost ground, it said.
Bike sales globally rose 4 percent in 2008, while footwear and equipment sales were flat and apparel was off 1 percent, NPD said.
The footwear segment was dragged down by a 3 percent decline in the Americas, while apparel's results included a 4 percent decline in Europe, according to NPD. (Reporting by Ben Klayman; editing by John Wallace)
