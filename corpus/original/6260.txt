(Reuters) - China's Foreign Ministry on Monday hit back at fresh calls by the United States for Beijing to let the yuan currency rise in value, saying the exchange rate was not to blame for the U.S. trade deficit with China.
"A huge amount of facts has demonstrated the renminbi exchange rate is not the main cause of the imbalance in Sino-U.S. trade," Qin said in a statement on the Ministry's website (www.mfa.gov.cn).
"Do not politicize the renminbi exchange rate issue," he said. The renminbi is another name for the yuan currency.
Qin said the Chinese government would keep the yuan exchange rate stable at a "reasonable and balanced" level and proceed with reform in a "gradual and controllable" way, in a tone that largely reiterated Beijing's longstanding official line.
Complaints eased over the last two months as the euro zone debt crisis took center stage. But U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said last week that the yuan was an impediment to global rebalancing, suggesting that U.S. patience with China's currency policy was wearing thin.
Qin Gang said that imbalances in Sino-U.S. trade had mainly been caused by globalization and the international division of labor, citing that a 21 percent appreciation of the yuan against the dollar since 2005 had not helped to reduce the U.S. deficit.
He said U.S. exports to China has risen about 50 percent in the first quarter, but Washington's restrictions on high-tech exports were holding back trade.
