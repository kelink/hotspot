(Reuters) - The yen fell on Tuesday, snapping back from its highest levels this month against the dollar and euro and retreating against commodity-linked currencies as Asian share markets steadied after losses.

"The market needs to examine whether hopes that China will support the global economy will remain intact from now on. There are some positive signs from data in industrialised nations, and we need to see if they become more substantial," Sera at Sumitomo Trust & Banking said.
