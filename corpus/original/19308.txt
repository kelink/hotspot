METALS-Copper at 3-week low as flu, financial woes weigh
2009-04-28 15:45:00.0
(Reuters) - Copper slipped to a new three-week low on Tuesday, as worries about the health of the U.S. financial sector and jitters about a potential swine flu pandemic continued to deflate recent optimism in the market.
"Sentiment in the market seems to have soured a bit," said Tom Hartman, broker with Altavest Worldwide Trading in Mission Viejo, California. "We went from a great rally in the first quarter of the year to just a bear market rally ... there's a lot of turmoil out there."
Copper for July delivery HGN9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division fell 6.90 cents, or nearly 3.5 percent, to settle at $1.9165 a lb, its lowest level on a settlement basis since April 2.
On the London Metal Exchange (LME), copper for three-months delivery MCU3 dropped to $4,158 a tonne, its lowest since April 3, before bouncing to close at $4,220 a tonne.

Since climbing to a six-month peak just below $5,000 a tonne in London and $2.25 a lb in New York earlier in the month, the metal has surrendered more than 15 percent of its value.
"We're seeing a little bit of that bullish optimism in the market deflating a bit," said Matthew Zeman, head of trading with LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago. "Copper is a great example of a market that had gotten way ahead of itself."
"Consumer confidence is rising, but whether or not people spend money will be dependent on these bank stress tests," Altavest's Hartman said.
Fears over the economic impact of the flu outbreak weighed on markets, but a weak demand outlook has been dragging on metals in the past week, particularly copper, which has risen more than 40 percent since the start of the year due to falling inventories and Chinese buying.
Latest data from the International Copper Study Group (ICSG) confirmed that gloomy demand outlook. ICSG said the world copper market saw a surplus of 155,000 tonnes in January, compared with a deficit of 22,000 tonnes in January 2008. [ID:nSP424871]
"The current surplus should be smaller if we look at falling stockpiles at LME and Shanghai Futures Exchange," said Judy Zhu, an analyst at Standard Chartered.
LME copper stocks have been falling since February and on Tuesday, dropped by 5,000 tonnes to a three-month low of 420,275 tonnes.
Canceled warrants -- material earmarked for delivery -- rose to 70,125 tonnes from 67,600 tonnes the day before. The market believes the recent rise in canceled warrants represents metal heading for China, the world's biggest copper consumer.
"Copper stocks are dropping substantially so this is still positive," said Andrey Kryuchenkov, an analyst at VTB Capital. "And canceled warrants are holding up -- there's still support from the physical side."
Aluminum MAL3, used in transport and packaging, closed at $1,436 a tonne from $1,446, with losses limited despite a massive jump of 24,650 tonnes in stocks, bringing the total to a record above 3.7 million tonnes.
Zinc MZN3, used to galvanize steel, was down at $1,341 from $1,372, while battery material lead MPB3 fell to $1,292 from $1,360. Nickel MNI3 was at $10,920 from $11,375.
Tin MSN3 was at $11,900 a tonne from Monday's $12,400, having dropped nearly 6 percent to a day's low of $11,700 a tonne. Metal Prices at 1925 GMT Metal Last Change Pct Move End 2008 Ytd Pct
