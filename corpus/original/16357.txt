(Reuters) - China's quality inspection agency has halted the import of several models made by French carmaker Renault (
), citing what it called "serious safety risks" and failure to meet technical standards.
The General Administration of Quality Supervision Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) said on its website (www.aqsia.gov.cn) the ban covered Renault's Laguna Ph2, Scenic, Megane Ph2 and Megane Ph2 Coupe-Cabriolet.
"In recent import inspections, we have repeatedly found batches of passenger vehicles made by the French Renault...do not conform with our country's mandatory standards and relevant technical regulations, and there are serious safety risks," it said in a statement.
The statement, however, did not specify what safety problems it had identified. The quality watchdog urged Renault to carefully examine all vehicles exported to China to ensure the security of products to Chinese customers.
The Renault spokeswoman said China represented a very small market for the French manufacturer, with fewer than 900 cars sold there in 2008.
