(Reuters) - The Taiwan Stock Exchange aims to boost its alliances with other bourses in Asia by way of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and has no plans for mergers and acquisitions, its chairman said on Saturday.
"The global wave of exchange mergers has got nothing to do with us. So far, we don't really have the relevant regulations to allow that," Schive Chi, chairman of the exchange, told Reuters on the sidelines of the Boao Forum in China's southern province of Hainan.
The Taiwan bourse, located in the landmark Taipei 101, is open to discussions with counterparts in Shanghai and Tokyo on cross-listings of ETFs, investment funds that are traded on stock exchanges, Schive said.
Exchanges around the world are chasing cross-border deals to build scale and cut costs as competition increases from dark pools, though not all have met with success.

In southeast Asia, exchanges announced plans to market themselves jointly to international investors and said they were confident a venture to allow trading between some of them would be ready before the end of the year.
For now, Taiwan's stock exchange will focus on organic growth, Schive said.
The exchange, which has a total market capitalization of $800 billion, aims to have 55 initial public offerings (IPOs) and Taiwan Depositary Receipts (TDR) issuances this year, up from 39 last year, Schive said.
"Taiwan's strength is in technology, manufacturing and food products. These are the areas we hope to attract companies to list," said Schive, who was formerly the vice chairman of Taiwan's planning commission.
