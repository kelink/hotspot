Bank of China to step in as Saab part owner: source

(Reuters) - Saab's Dutch owner and China's Zhejiang Youngman Lotus Automobile have agreed that the Bank of China, the nation's fourth-largest bank by market value, will come in as part owner of the ailing carmaker, according to a source familiar with the deal.
Under the new deal, the Bank of China will replace Chinese investor Pang Da Automobile Trade Co. Youngman and the Bank of China will own just under 50 percent of the company.
The move could help pave the way for an approval by General Motors, which still has preferential shares in Saab and rejected an earlier rescue plan. It said in November it would stop supplying components and technology if Youngman and Pang Da succeeded with their acquisition bid.
The salaries, which are already a little more than a week late, will be paid to Saab staff on Monday.
Pang Da operates auto dealerships in China while Youngman produces commercial vehicles, including buses and trucks, and sells cars under the Lotus brand.

This will be a good move for all stakeholders. It will continue an established brand with a long reputation for quality, and it will offer more choices for the biggest automobile market in the world with new buyers who can afford quality.
