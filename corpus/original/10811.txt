(Reuters) - China's key stock index opened down 0.7 percent on Tuesday, led by Yangtze Power (
), as negative factors including weak investor sentiment and the stock regulator's continued reviews of initial public offerings offset a positive purchasing managers' index.
opened at 2,649.168 points, after diving 6.74 percent on Monday and posting its second-biggest monthly loss in 15 years in August, hit by new share supplies and high share valuations that got ahead of earnings improvements.
Yangtze Power, the most active stock in early trade, tumbled 4.29 percent to 12.72 yuan after it said its shareholders had approved a plan for a private share placement.
China's stock regulator said late on Monday it would review on Friday an application by China National Chemical Engineering Co (CNCEC) for a stock IPO worth around $428 million. [ID:nSHA61121]
State media reported on Tuesday that China's four biggest state-owned banks issued only 135 billion yuan in new loans in the first 30 days of August, with all banks lending less than 300 billion yuan in the month, down sharply from July's already small 356 billion yuan.
"Reviewing an IPO after a steep market fall, plus shrinking bank lending -- all this negative news is leading the index to fall and fill a gap on the charts from late May around 2,635 points," said Wen Lijun, analyst from Nanjing Securities.
She added, however, that the steep fall in the Chinese stock market did not necessarily reflect expectations or developments regarding China's economic recovery.
Indeed, China's official purchasing managers' index (PMI) for August inched up to 54.0 from July's 53.3.
It was the sixth straight month that the official PMI stood above 50, indicating an expansion of activity in the manufacturing sector. A reading below 50 suggests contraction. A record low of 38.8 was plumbed in November. [ID:nBJC000453] (Reporting by Claire Zhang and Edmund Klamann)
