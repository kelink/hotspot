(Reuters) - A report that China nixed a fuel price rise at the last minute appeared to gain credibility when a Hong Kong newspaper reported on Friday that a southern Chinese industry body had published, and then retracted, the increase.
The Guangdong Oil and Gas Association said on Thursday that China would raise retail prices for diesel by 500 yuan per tonne and gasoline prices by 520 yuan, the Hong Kong Economic Times reported on Friday.
But the association later said Beijing had postponed the rise in prices, without citing a reason.
China's government keeps a tight hold over fuel prices, announcing nationwide changes to ceiling prices according to the government's own schedule.
The secretive price-setting process, coupled with the importance of China's huge fuels market and the government's promise to adjust prices more often from the start of this year, has fuelled frequent rumours about imminent price changes.
The association's price rise figures match those given late on Thursday by CBI China, which said on its website that the government was about to adjust prices, but then said the rise had been cancelled. [ID:nPEK302240]
) rose on Friday on expectations of the hike, which would be equivalent to 8-9 percent on the price of fuel.
The Hong Kong-listed shares of PetroChina gained 4.8 percent, while Sinopec was up 4.6 percent by 0634 GMT. China introduced a new price setting mechanism at the start of this year which it said would lead to more frequent adjustments in retail prices, allowing them to fluctuate more closely in line with global crude oil prices.
The government last adjusted prices on March 25, raising them by 3-5 percent.
