(Reuters) - Trade ties between China and Norway remain strong, with talks for a free trade agreement on track despite Chinese anger at a dissident winning the Nobel Peace Prize, Norway's Fisheries Minister said on Friday.
"In trade and seafood everything is fine. We have a very good relationship between China and Norway both in shipping and in seafood and in many other trade areas," Lisbeth Berg-Hansen, told Reuters in an interview at the Shanghai World Expo.
However, Norwegian news agency NTB reported that the Norwegian foreign minister had protested to the Chinese ambassador in Oslo about Beijing's reaction to the award.
Beijing has canceled several official meetings with Norway after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, warning relations with the country would suffer, calling the award "obscenity.
Norway is home to the Nobel Peace Prize committee, though the government there has no say in who receives it. China says Liu is a criminal and that giving him the Nobel was a direct insult to the Chinese legal system.
Last year Norway, the world's fifth biggest oil exporter, sold goods worth 16.1 billion crowns ($2.76 billion) to China and imported roughly twice as much.
A China-Norway free-trade agreement currently being negotiated is among the first such bilateral deals considered by China, now the world's second biggest economy and hungry for the oil, gas and other resources that Norway can provide.
"The negotiations for free trade, it is not my area, but yes these talks are on track, I know," the minister said.
"I have had two meetings canceled but that is it," she said.
