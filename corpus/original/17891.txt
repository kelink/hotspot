(Reuters) - India's Tata Steel (
) said it had not yet received an indication from Italy's Marcegaglia and South Korea's Dongkuk Steel (
Marcegaglia and Dongkuk in January agreed to buy an 80 percent stake in the Teesside plant in England, valuing it at an estimated $600 million. The memorandum of understanding for the sale expires in June.
J.J. Irani, a director at parent holding company Tata Sons, told reporters at a steel conference on Wednesday that the sale would not go ahead.
Tata Steel said earlier this month that Corus might have to indefinitely suspend operations at its Teesside plant after a consortium that included Marcegaglia and Dongkuk cancelled a major contract to buy the plant's output.
Irani said he expected hot rolled coil prices to stabilise at between $375 and $400 a tonne, down from current rates of between $400 and $415 a tonne.
"We can see this stabilisation happening immediately from now till the (end of the) year ... because Chinese prices have been in that region for almost a year and China has a lot of influence on the world," he said.
The World Steel Association forecast last month that global steel demand would tumble 15 percent this year, its steepest fall since World War II.
However, Irani said he expected Indian steel demand to rise between 5 percent and 8 percent this year. While slowing, the Indian economy is still expected to grow around 6 percent in the fiscal year ending March 2010.
Tata Steel shares ended the day up 12.8 percent at 371.30 rupees, their highest in more than seven months, in a Mumbai market that fell 1.7 percent. (Writing by Narayanan Somasundaram; editing by John Mair and Karen Foster)
