(Reuters) - Fortune Oil Plc (
), which manages oil and gas supply and infrastructure projects in China, said on Wednesday its annual pretax profit almost doubled, boosted by its gas business, pushing its shares higher.
At 0941 GMT, the company's shares were up 13.6 percent at 6.85 pence, having earlier hit 7.60 pence, their highest price since mid November.
"Despite all the uncertainty in world markets, Fortune Oil achieved an outstanding result in 2008, delivering a record performance in the Fortune Gas and Trading subsidiary operations," said Chairman Qian Benyuan.
However, its Bluesky aviation refuelling business made a negative contribution because of inventory writedowns and provisions for bad debts following volatility in jet fuel prices.
As a result of the losses at Bluesky, some of the group's directors have waived part of their 2008 remuneration and bonuses, with Chief Executive Li Ching returning all of her 104,000 pound bonus for the year.
