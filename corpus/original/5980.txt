Trade gap widens unexpectedly in May

(Reuters) - The trade deficit widened unexpectedly in May, led by a big jump in imports from China that helped overpower the best month for U.S. exports since September 2008, a government report showed on Tuesday.
The trade gap widened 4.8 percent to $42.3 billion, the largest since November 2008, defying a consensus Wall Street forecast for it to narrow in May to $39.0 billion.
Imports rose 2.9 percent to the highest since October 2008, led by a 12.1 percent increase in shipments from China and stronger U.S. demand for consumer goods, autos and capital goods.
The big jump in imports from China is consistent with that country's own trade data, which showed exports rising sharply in May and June from year-ago levels.
Exports had their best showing since September 2008, when world trade was in the early stages of a deep plunge as a result of the global financial crisis.

Less dependency of oil by 10%, increase in US export 2.4%, and increase in export by %2.9 which is definitely a mixed reaction from me

It seems like Americans will only complain about Obama and how he treats the economy. But, Americans don¡¯t want to make their own effort to help with things. Here is a hint for the American people: STOP BUYING IMPORTS!!!!! Why is that so difficult to understand. It decreases from our GDP every time we have a trade gap like this.
