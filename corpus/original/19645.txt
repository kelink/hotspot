(Reuters) - French car parts maker Valeo (
) posted a first-quarter operating loss and a 33.4 percent drop in sales, and pledged to step up its cost-cutting plans in the face of the global automotive industry crisis.
Valeo posted a first-quarter operating loss of 66 million euros ($86 million) on Friday, after a 99 million profit a year ago. Sales fell 33.4 percent to 1.624 billion euros, compared with a 38 percent drop in automobile production.
Scrapping schemes -- where governments have funded bonuses for drivers trading in old cars for new, greener models -- have led to a "slight improvement" in some markets, Valeo said, citing France, Germany, Italy, Brazil and China.
European passenger car sales fell 17.2 percent in the first quarter, industry association ACEA said earlier this month.
The group posted a first-quarter net loss of 159 million euros, compared with a net profit of 43 million euros in the first quarter of 2008.
Valeo said in a statement it planned to cut 2009 investment by a third compared with 2008 and pledged annualised cost savings of 600 million euros, of which 500 million in 2009.
The company, which has a new chief executive after Jacques Aschenbroich was appointed to replace Thierry Morin who left in March over strategic differences, said it was aiming for a free cash flow consumption "not significantly exceeding" restructuring expenses.
Valeo said it achieved cost savings of 183 million euros in the first quarter from the cost saving plan it launched late last year. As of March 31, 3,230 job cuts had been made worlwide. It announced a plan for 5,000 job cuts in December.
Valeo said net financial debt stood at 933 million euros at the end of March, when it also had undrawn confirmed credit lines of 1.2 billion.
Valeo is 8.33 percent owned by the French state whose strategic investment fund, set up to help struggling companies, bought a stake in February, adding to its existing holding. [ID:nLP693700]
Valeo, whose major customers include French carmakers Renault (
), said it would stop publishing quarterly earnings figures from 2010, releasing only sales figures instead. (Reporting by Helen Massy-Beresford) ($1 = 0.7678 euro)
