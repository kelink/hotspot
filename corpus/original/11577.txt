(Reuters) - Zambia's economy will likely grow by 5 percent in 2009 on the back of Chinese and Indian investments into the mining sector, said Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry Felix Mutati on Thursday.
"We will probably be able to achieve 5 percent economic growth. The growth is likely to come from increased foreign direct investment, especially from China and India, into the mining sector," he said in an interview with Reuters.
"Instead of taking their investment to Europe and the U.S, they are looking into investing in Africa ... the crisis confirms that Africa is not a major risk as an investment destination."
In June, Zambia had downgraded its growth forecast to 4.0 percent for 2009 from 5.8 percent, citing lower prices of copper -- the mainstay of the economy.
Copper has gained nearly 40 percent since early July as funds have poured money into the industrial metals, betting the worst is over in the global recession and the latter part of the year will see better metals demand.
Foreign lenders and investors have praised Zambia's government for conservative fiscal policies credited with fuelling an economic boom, with growth having averaged more than 5 percent a year since 2002. (Reporting by Chris Mfula; Editing by Jon Boyle)
