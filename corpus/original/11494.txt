(Reuters) - European equities drifted lower in early trade on Friday after sharp gains in the previous day, with energy stocks tracking weaker crude oil prices and autos slipping ahead of the end of a U.S. rebate programme.
At 0712 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300
index of top European shares was down 0.2 percent at 942.84 points after gaining 1.4 percent on Thursday. The index, which slumped 45 percent in 2008, is still up 13 percent this year and has jumped 46 percent since a record low in March.
"We have had a rally of around 50 percent, so profit taking is quite normal. But overall market sentiment is positive and momentum is good. Just keep an eye on China," said Koen De Leus, economist at KBC Securities.
"The most decisive things now is the Chinese stock market and as long as the Chinese market holds up, the risky asset will hold as well," he added.
