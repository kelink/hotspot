(Reuters) - The meteoric rise of China's Huawei to challenge the world's top telecom gear makers has been mainly in secondary markets, but a serious push into larger, more profitable, developed markets may hinge on an image makeover.
Huawei Technologies HWT.UL has been winning client kudos and market share, especially in developing markets where pricing is a more critical factor.

Those concerns derailed an attempt by Huawei and partner Bain Capital to buy U.S.-based 3Com COMS.O in 2007, and last month the Financial Times reported that Huawei had blamed unfounded security concerns in India for hobbling its growth there.
"If anyone wants to be a world class telecom gear maker it must be in those two markets," said Edward Yu, chief executive of Beijing-based researcher Analysys International, referring to the United States and Japan, the world's two largest markets.
"The best chance for Huawei, if it wants to gain more market share in those two countries, is to transform itself and become more transparent," Yu said.

The 21-year-old firm's media shy founder was an officer in China's military and helped build its communications network before starting Huawei to make the switches, networks, routers and, increasingly, the software used to direct data around telecoms networks.
