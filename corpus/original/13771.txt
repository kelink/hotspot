(Reuters) - The bid deadline for private equity-backed Kosmos Energy's Ghanaian oil interests has been extended and another date will be announced within the next 30 days, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Any bid would need to be vetted by the Ghanaian government. Extending the deadline will lengthen the auction process but should shorten the time between signing and closing the deal, the sources said. They declined to be named because the discussions have not been made public.
Kosmos Energy has been considering selling its stake in the large Jubilee oil field offshore Ghana for several months, sources have previously told Reuters.
The stake is predicted to hold 1.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent and could fetch $3-5 billion, analysts have said.
