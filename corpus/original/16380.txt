(Reuters) - Luxury sports carmaker Lamborghini sees no recovery in its markets until 2011 after a 30 percent drop in sales in the first five months of this year, Chief Executive Stephan Winkelmann said on Wednesday.
Still, first-half figures would be positive, and the company, based in Sant'Agata Bolognese in central Italy, would achieve a full-year pre-tax profit, Winkelmann told the Reuters Global Luxury Summit.
"We could stay profitable with sales that are dropping at 40 percent (in 2009). We are foreseeing a scenario that is staying on the same level next year and coming back in 2011," he said. "I'm prepared to face another tough year in 2010."
Known for its low, sleek designs and high top speeds, Lamborghini identifies itself as "uncompromising and extreme." Its badge carries the image of a bull.
"We are the bad boys," Winkelmann said. Its main competitor is Ferrari, owned by Italian carmaker Fiat (
), owned by Europe's biggest carmaker, Germany's Volkswagen (
Lamborghini sold 2,430 cars in 2008 and prices range from 170,000 euros to 360,000 euros, Winkelmann said.
Its biggest market is still the United States despite a fall in sales of over 40 percent there in the first five months. Winkelmann said he expected China to overtake Italy as its second-biggest market in the next three to five years, up from ninth-biggest last year.
Winkelmann said the company had cut production by 30 percent in line with the sales fall this year. But even so, waiting time for deliveries had fallen to 6 months from over a year.
Lamborghini is in "constant dialogue" with its suppliers to help them "bridge a difficult situation," Winkelmann said. It has temporarily laid off workers for seven weeks in total so far under an Italian state-supported scheme.
"We are in the middle of the line between suppliers and dealers and we also have to deal with the unions," he said.
"I think the crisis is very deep," he said.
"You buy it because it's a dream," he said.
The average car produces 150-160 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer while the average Lamborghini produces more than 400 grams. The EU's target for most carmakers is 120 grams by 2012.
