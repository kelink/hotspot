(Reuters) - Agricultural Bank of China ABC.UL, will submit a plan to China's Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) on May 28, ahead of the bank's $30 billion IPO, local media reported on Saturday.
AgBank, the smallest of the country's Big Four banks, will hold its first assessment meeting -- for what would be the world's largest-ever initial public offering (IPO) --, on May 25, the National Business Daily reported.
If the meeting goes smoothly, the Bank would then submit a plan to the CSRC later in the week. The paper did not give details on what type of plan would be submitted.
The bank, which plans to list in Hong Kong and Shanghai by July, has already submitted documents to both the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, sources with direct knowledge told Reuters earlier in May.
The National Business Daily cited a lawyer familiar with the IPO as saying AgBank's application has entered a substantiative stage. The report did not mention any potential delays for the listing.
China's pension fund has invested 15 billion yuan ($2.20 billion) into the Agricultural Bank of China ABC.UL, ahead of the bank's $30 billion IPO, an official said on Friday.
