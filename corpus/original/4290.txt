China challenges WTO ruling on U.S. tire tariffs

(Reuters) - China appealed a ruling by the World Trade Organization on Tuesday, insisting the United States flouted international trade rules when it imposed trade barriers on car tires imported from China, a WTO spokesman said.
Widely expected, Beijing's appeal underlines tensions between rich and emerging economies over trade in industrial goods, which are threatening a global trade pact among the WTO's 153 members known as the Doha round.
The United States has until May 30 to lodge a counter appeal over its rights to tax Chinese tires, though U.S. trade officials in Geneva could not be reached for comment on plans for such an appeal.
The WTO's finding last December that U.S. tariffs against China were legal gave a victory not only to the Obama administration but also to the United Steelworkers union that had complained surging imports of Chinese tires were hurting U.S. producers.
The WTO's appellate body generally takes three months to reach a decision on whether to uphold or reject all or part of a previous WTO ruling.
