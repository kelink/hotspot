(Reuters) - Britain's leading share index advanced 1.3 percent in early trade on Monday in a charge led by banks, following results from HSBC (
), and supported by miners and oil stocks.
At 0858 GMT, the FTSE 100
was 60.09 points higher at 4,668.45. The index closed down 23.25 points on Friday at 4,608.36, but still had its best weekly performance since April 2003, reaching a 7-month high on Thursday.
HSBC, Europe's biggest bank, reported a pretax profit for the six months to the end of June of $5.02 billion, down from $10.2 billion a year earlier but just ahead of an average forecast of $4.9 billion from 11 analysts polled by Reuters.
Barclays fell short of expectations with an 8 percent rise in half-year profit as bad debts at Britain's second biggest bank almost doubled to offset buoyant earnings from its enlarged investment bank.

), scheduled to release its figures on Wednesday, firmed 0.7 percent, and Royal Bank of Scotland (
), which reports on Friday, added 2.2 percent.
