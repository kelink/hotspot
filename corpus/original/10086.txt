2009-10-12 15:02:00.0
(Reuters) - Copper ended firm and aluminum climbed to a near one-month high on Monday, buoyed by a weaker dollar that helped feed gains in the broader complex, while a looming strike in Chile supported the move.
But sentiment among the thousands of metals and mining industry executives gathered for the London Metal Exchange (LME) week was cautious on copper's price prospects as they said demand remained poor.

Copper for December delivery HGZ9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division ended up 1.90 cents at $2.8570 a lb, after dealing in a session range between $2.8380 and $2.8770.
On the LME, copper for three-months delivery MCU3 closed down $55 at $6,275 a tonne, while aluminum MAL3 rose to $1,958 a tonne, its highest since September 18.
"We're up on the weaker dollar today," said Frank Lesh, broker and futures analyst with Future Path Trading in Chicago. "Gold's moving higher, crude oil is up, agricultural products are up as well, so it looks like we're back to the old commodity trade ... short the dollar, buy commodities."

The price of copper, used extensively in construction, has more than doubled this year on the back of Chinese restocking and on improved signs for the global economic growth.
But the rally has stalled since August, and analysts doubt it has further legs.
"Sentiment is upbeat ... but sentiment alone is not enough to push the market to new highs," said Andrey Kryuchenkov, analyst at VTB Capital, adding fundamentals needed to improve before prices can forge higher.
Last week, upbeat data on the U.S. service sector and German manufacturing supported markets. [ID:nN05400003] [ID:nL7400974]
But a new rise in copper stocks capped sentiment. Inventories at LME warehouses rose 775 tonnes to 347,375 tonnes, their highest since mid-May. Stocks have risen since mid-July, reversing a trend of consistent falls earlier this year.
"The world economy is by no means out of the woods, but in our view the theme during LME Week will be the prospect of demand recovery in 2010," Royal Bank of Scotland said in a note.
Investors are also eyeing China's preliminary September trade data, due on Wednesday, to see whether demand from the world's top consumer of base metals is holding up.

Aluminum MAL3, used in transport and packaging, ended the day at $1,947 a tonne, from $1,909.
Aluminum could rise further in the short term as restocking across the supply chain overcomes the impact of excess inventory and capacity in the market, JP Morgan said. [ID:nL9662064]
