Gold dragged other metals lower as its price plunged to a more than two-year low. Brent crude fell towards $100 a barrel, while on Wall Street stocks dropped more than 2 percent for the S&P 500's worst day since November 7.
With the market already vulnerable, U.S. stocks extended losses late in the session after two explosions struck near the Boston Marathon finish line. Boston police said the blasts killed two people and injured 23.
Spot gold dropped as much as 9 percent on Monday alone, falling as low as $1,336.04 an ounce. In the last two sessions gold has fallen over 13 percent, for the worst two days since late February 1983. Gold was recently at $1,346.26.
Strategists have cited various reasons for gold's slump, including plans by Cyprus to sell excess gold reserves and feared selling from other central banks.
"The pressure from the proposed sale of Cyprus gold is one of the factors, and once one of them starts, they all run from the hen house," said Robert Richardson, senior account executive and trading officer at Canadian broker-dealer W.D. Latimer Co. Ltd.
China's recovery unexpectedly stumbled in the first three months of 2013, as it reported its annual growth rate eased to 7.7 percent from 7.9 percent in the final quarter of last year. Economists had forecast 8 percent growth.
A U.S. regional manufacturing report on Monday showed the pace of growth slowed, the latest data to suggest the world's biggest economy lost some steam heading into the second quarter.
"China makes up 40 percent of demand for base metals and all the growth in demand for oil is coming from the developing world, so to see weakness in China is bad for commodities generally," said Nic Brown, head of commodities research at Natixis in London.
"If we see this kind of liquidation again, the equity market will follow. Then we'll have a real problem," said Frank Cholly, Jr., senior commodities broker at R.J. O'Brien and Associates in Chicago.
"If we turn into a bear market and this isn't just a correction, sentiment may really sour. There is no one buying and picking a bottom yet."
Copper fell to its lowest in 1-1/2 years. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange fell to $7,085 a metric ton (1.1023 tons) in intraday trade, its lowest since October 2011.
Silver lost 12 percent at $22.71 an ounce, having fallen as low as $22.56.
"The adverse feedback loop of all these things ... that's spilling over to stocks and that's something most investors don't want to get in front of. So we've seen selling really dominate the day today," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.
dropped 265.86 points, or 1.79 percent, to close at 14,599.20. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index
lost 36.49 points, or 2.30 percent, to end at 1,552.36. The Nasdaq Composite Index
fell 78.46 points, or 2.38 percent, to 3,216.49.
ended down 0.6 percent and MSCI's world share index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks stocks in 45 countries, lost 1.8 percent.

Giles Elgood should be fired; or at the very least, sent back to high school for such lousy editing. Journalism standards at Reuters has slipped to practically non-existent lately. Poorly written, barely ¨C if at all ¨C researched stories and the worst editing I¡¯ve ever seen. How do you justify the paychecks Reuters? Your writers would never survive my professors at UNC.

Trust¡­ obey¡­ your government everything is okay pertaining to the economy. War(s) without end, war(s) on credit and WallStreet fraud along with increasing the size of government 3 fold with the inception of Homeland Security had zero effect on our economy. Printing money out of thin air has a price and soon all will realize just what the price was.
