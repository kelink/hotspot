(Reuters) - China Investment Corp, the country's sovereign wealth fund, said it is buying into a $2.2 billion common stock offering by Morgan Stanley (
) because it is confident in the Wall Street bank's prospects.
CIC is buying 44.7 million shares of the 80.2 million shares being offered for $1.2 billion, raising its stake in Morgan Stanley back to about 9.86 percent.
"Morgan Stanley is widely expected to be able to leverage on its strengthened financial position and will be on the road of resuming its successful trajectory amid the dramatic restructuring of the international financial services industry," CIC said in a statement on its website, www.china-inv.cn.
Morgan Stanley said the proceeds of the offering, priced on Tuesday at $27.44 a share, would bring it closer to repaying $10 billion it borrowed under the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program. [ID:nN02496921]
