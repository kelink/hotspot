U.S. says China, Taiwan, Mexico and UAE dumping products

(Reuters) - The Commerce Department on Friday set preliminary anti-dumping duty rates on products from China, Taiwan, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates it said were being sold in the United States at unfairly low prices.
The department said Chinese and Taiwanese companies were dumping certain optical brightening agents used in laundry detergent, paper and cosmetics.
The ruling was a victory for North Carolina-based Clariant Corp, which asked for relief earlier this year.
A group of U.S. wire companies from several states -- Davis Wire Corp, Johnstown Wire Technologies Inc, Mid-South Wire Company Inc, National Standard LLC and Oklahoma Steel & Wire Company Inc -- asked for duties.
Missouri-based Mid Continent Nail Corporation brought the case. Last year, the UAE exported more than $101.5 million of steel nails to the United States last year.
Until then, producers and exporters from the four countries will have to post bonds or cash deposits equal to the preliminary duty rates.
