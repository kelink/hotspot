North Korea border guards kill five defectors to China: report

(Reuters) - North Korean border guards, in a rare cross-border pursuit, shot dead five defectors and wounded two others who fled the reclusive state into China, a South Korean newspaper reported on Tuesday.
The Chosun Ilbo reported that North Korean border guards had never before shot at defectors once they had reached the Chinese side of the border, adding that guards could have been issued with new instructions for dealing with defectors.
Five were shot dead by North Korean border guards who were in pursuit and two were wounded and taken to the North, it said.
The Sino-Korean border, in China's northeast, is quiet and fairly porous, with a steady flow of refugees and traders coming over to escape food shortages or profit from them.
Beijing tolerates the cross-border traffic in part because it is fearful that a collapse of the regime would turn that trickle into a flood, and could one day mean South Korean or even U.S. troops stationed on its border.

North Korea is a cult. Watch how many ¡°drink the Kool Aid¡± when the time comes. The rest will be shot.
