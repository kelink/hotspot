(Reuters) - Shares of China's BBMG Corp (
) surged 65 percent in their Hong Kong trading debut on Wednesday after an overwhelming response to its $768 million IPO, fuelled by strong interest in newly listed stocks.
Beijing-based BBMG is one of the largest building materials manufacturers in China, a leading property developer and a large-scale property investment and management company, according to its website.
The stock extended gains to HK$10.50 shortly after opening at HK$10.20, compared with an initial public offering (IPO) price of HK$6.38.
Hefty liquidity in the market has been drawn to IPO shares, but some analysts expressed concern over stretched valuations.
"This company is just a Beijing-play, not a national one, so a 20 to 21 times P/E valuation looks quite pricey. But its a demand and supply thing; in the short term there aren't enough new shares coming in, so it may still find takers at this valuation," said Peter Pak, vice-president with BOCI Research.
The company has benefitted from China's economic stimulus measures as much of the budget is related to BBMG's core businesses, which include affordable housing projects, transportation, water and electricity infrastructure.
Based on BBMG's financial data and its IPO offering range, Phillip Securities estimated a multiple of about 8.8-10.9 times 2010 earnings. The note said that the valuation was cheap compared with Anhui Conch's expected multiple of 16.8 times and CNBM's expected multiple of 11.4 times.
