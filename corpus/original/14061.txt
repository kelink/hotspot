--Public sector unions have rejected calls for restraint by state and territory governments facing a blowout in wage bills. Analysts say that the states, which are locked into existing agreements negotiated during the boom years, are facing a 5.5 percent rise in wages this financial year to almost A$69 billion. The Community and Public Sector Union's joint national secretary, David Carey, says that although the states are headed into deficit, the deficits are "relatively small" compared with gross state product.

--China has expanded its inquiry into iron ore trading, following the detention of an Australian executive and three other employees of mining company Rio Tinto. Chinese reports say that investigators are studying confidential material relating to more than 10 Chinese steel mills found on a computer at the Shanghai offices of Rio Tinto. Mining companies BHP Billiton (
)BLT.AX and Vale may be drawn into the inquiry, according to Chinese analysts. There are reports that some Australian employees of both Rio and BHP have left China in recent days. Page 1.
--Business confidence has returned to levels not seen since before the start of the global economic crisis, according to a survey by National Australia Bank. The survey, conducted in June, found an increase in profits, export sales and orders, as well as a record increase in employment expectations as employers increasingly preferred to retain workers rather than retrench them. Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan reacted cautiously to suggestions of an early recovery in the economy, saying that "the global recession still has a way to run." Page 1.
-- Australian publishers have warned that a plan to make books more affordable by removing import restrictions could threaten the future of Australian literature. The Productivity Commission has found that existing parallel importation rules "place upward pressure on book prices" and should be abolished. Major publishers have called on the Federal Government to implement the recommendations, saying prices will drop significantly. However, the Australian Publishers Association described the report as "a triumph of arid, free-market dogma." Page 3.
--Health authorities have warned that a spike in swine flu infections has increased pressure on hospital emergency departments. Chief Medical Officer Jim Bishop said yesterday that Australia had 9828 swine flu cases as of noon yesterday, with the death toll standing at 20 after a 55-year-old man died in Sydney's St George Hospital on Saturday. Dr Bishop said "we'd anticipate that, as with the normal flu season, this will start to peak really in August, so we've still got some way to go." Page 3.
--A Brisbane District Court judge has told jurors in the corruption case against former Queensland government minister Gordon Nuttall that they must not allow sympathies or prejudices to influence their deliberations. In her summing up yesterday, Chief Judge Patsy Wolfe told the jury they should focus on the evidence and "exclude all other considerations." Nuttall, 56, has pleaded not guilty to charges involving secret commissions worth A$360,000 paid to him by Macarthur Coal founder Ken Talbot and coalmining executive Harold Shand. Page 3 .
-- Four in ten Australian workers do not have enough savings to last more than four weeks without work, according to a new survey. The Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) Consumer Credit Expectations Survey of 1203 workers aged between 18 and 64 also found that 38 percent of workers planned to use their credit cards this financial quarter in order to cover bills. D&B chief executive Christine Christian warned that the use of credit by previously financially stable households could damage Australia's chances of economic recovery in the near term. Page 7.
-- The Federal Government has awarded a grant of A$59,050 to restore the home of Australia's best known Aboriginal artist Albert Namatjiri, amid reports that the artist never actually lived there. Heritage Minister Peter Garrett announced the grant yesterday, saying that the money would be used to repair and renovate "Albert Namitjira's house" in Hermannsburg, west of Alice Springs. But leading Northern Territory historian Peter Forrest says "anyone who's been around for a while would know he never lived there." Page 3.
--Thousands of overseas students are being forced to work for free by Australian businesses exploiting federal immigration laws, according to a new report. Under changes announced in 2005, vocational students were ordered to perform 900 hours of work experience as part of an almost-guaranteed pathway to permanent residence, but there was no requirement that they be paid. Immigration agents say many students are now working for free or paying employers up to A$20,000 for fraudulent letters of completion. Page 1.
--An analysis of Federal Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull's electorate fundraising arm has found that its donors include almost 20 individuals or families listed amongst the country's richest 200. Contributors to the Wentworth Forum, set up in 2007 when Mr Turnbull was environment minister in the Howard government, include Seven Network chairman Kerry Stokes, Westfield founder Frank Lowy and Aussie Home Loans founder John Symond. The forum offers the most generous supporters more opportunities for access to Mr Turnbull. Page 1
--Industrial waste in the drinking water of the New South Wales town of Lithgow could be the reason for the area having some of the state's worst rates of cancer and other health problems, according to local doctors. All of the town's general practitioners have signed a letter to the local council opposing a plan to nearly double the amount of recycled industrial water that is added to its drinking supply. "Lithgow residents unfortunately suffer from some of the worst statistics in the state," the doctors' letter says. Page 1.
--Governments may have grossly underestimated the human cost of road deaths, according to researchers at the University of Sydney. Government planners assessing the roadworks budget estimate that each road death costs society A$1.5 million, based on medical expenses and lost income. But David Hensher, from the University of Sydney's Institute of Transport and Logistics Studies, says the cost of each death is closer to A$6 million. Mr Hensher says that adopting the higher figure would make fixing dangerous roads a higher priority. Page 2.
--Trials of a new device aimed at treating heart disease are underway in Melbourne. Surgeon Rob Whitbourn implanted a dissolvable stent into a patient at St Vincent's hospital last week as part of a global trial aimed at testing the cutting-edge technology. The trials follow increasing concern about existing metal stents, which can lead to scar tissue and plaque build up. "It makes a lot of sense and so far the signals are very positive," said Professor Whitbourn. Page 5 .
--The Greens party will move to set up a Senate inquiry into Australia's banking system in August unless the Federal Government agrees to establish an independent inquiry. Greens leader Bob Brown says that "at a time when we need robust diversity in financial systems, we instead are seeing a concentration in favour of banks -- and especially the Big Four banks, which are benefiting the most from the Rudd Government's guarantee." Independent Senator Nick Xenophon has promised to support the move for a Senate inquiry. Page 2. --
