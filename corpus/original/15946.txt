Rio announced the share sale two weeks ago after abandoning a planned tie-up with China's state-owned Chinalco, instead agreeing to set up a $116 billion iron ore joint venture with bigger rival BHP Billiton (
The 21-for-40 rights offer is being priced at A$28.29 for Rio Tinto Ltd shares and 1400 pence for Rio Tinto Plc shares, a massive discount to Rio's close in Australia at A$73.23 on Tuesday and 2,900 pence on Monday.
The money raised will be used to slash $38 billion in debt, which it took on to buy Canadian aluminium group Alcan in 2007 at the peak of the commodities boom.
