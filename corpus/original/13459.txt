), a maker of polishing compounds for the chip industry, posted a surprise third-quarter profit, helped by strong demand and inventory replenishments within the semiconductor industry, sending its shares up as much as 14 percent.
Reports by certain industry analysts indicate there is some strengthening of demand in segments like smartphones and netbooks, and some geographies such as China, Chief Executive William Noglows said in a conference call with analysts.
"In our view, there are a number of indications that the industry may have bottomed, but we are still cautious regarding future industry trends," he said.
For the quarter ended June 30, Cabot earned $9 million, or 39 cents per share, down from $10 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier.
Third-quarter revenue fell 11 percent to $86.4 million year-over-year, but demand for its products rose significantly from the second quarter across all business areas and geographies, the company said.
Analysts on average were expecting a loss of 8 cents a share, excluding exceptional items, on revenue of $66.2 million, according to Reuters Estimates.
Gross profit was 46.6 percent, down from 46.8 percent last year, hurt by a lower-valued product mix.
Shares of the company touched a high of $35.00, before paring some gains to trade up $2.28 at $33.10 in morning trade Thursday on Nasdaq.
