(Reuters) - Hang Seng Bank (
), a unit of global lender HSBC Holdings (
), expects its net interest margin to remain under pressure in the second half and will focus on non-interest income business, a senior executive said on Monday.
"Hong Kong's interest rates will follow the U.S. rate trend and are likely to stay at low levels in the next 12-18 months and that will put a pressure on our net interest margin," Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Margaret Leung told reporters.
Hang Seng Bank, which is 62 percent owned by HSBC (
), posted a 29 percent fall in first half net profit to HK$6.45 billion ($832.2 million) and the net interest margin fell 37 basis points to 2.06 percent during the reporting period.
The bank expects its corporate non-performing loan ratio to improve because factory orders are rising in Hong Kong and China, insurance and asset management sectors, Leung said.
Its loan business in China fell about 13 percent in the first half of 2009, but is expected to rise in the next six to 12 months as the bank will lend more to Hong Kong companies with businesses in China, she said.
Hang Seng Bank is also looking at investment opportunities in China's securities, insurance and asset management sectors.
Hang Seng Bank shares ended down 0.87 percent on Monday before the results were announced and have gained 23 percent this year, lagging a 45 percent rise on the blue chip Hang Seng Index
