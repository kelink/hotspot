(Reuters) - Title sponsorship of the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational has been extended for a further four years, keeping the elite World Golf Championships (WGC) event at Firestone Country Club until 2014.
"I think the happiest person today might be Tiger (Woods), winning 60 or 70 percent of the time he plays here," PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem told a news conference.
The PGA Tour has lost four title sponsors this year due to the global economic downturn and Finchem was delighted by the tire company's decision to extend the contract.
"For Bridgestone to make this commitment in a down economy speaks a lot about the value of PGA Tour golf and International Federation of PGA Tour golf from a branding standpoint, an advertising standpoint, a global reach standpoint and a business-to-business platform standpoint."
"This event continues to showcase the very best in professional golf to the world, all the while bringing tremendous economic and charitable impact to Northeast Ohio," Finchem said.
Bridgestone Americas Incorporated president Mark Emkes added: "Even in a down economy, we still need to sell Bridgestone golf balls, Bridgestone clubs, Bridgestone tyres and Firestone tyres.
WGC events bring together the world's top 50 golfers and are ranked just one rung down from the four majors.
Three of them are held in the United States with a fourth, the HSBC Champions tournament in China, gaining WGC status for the first time when this year's edition takes place at Shanghai's Sheshan International Golf Course on November 5-8.
World number one Woods has triumphed six times in just eight starts at Firestone, finishing no worse than tied for fourth.
