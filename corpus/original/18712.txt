Canadian foreign affairs spokesman Alain Cacchione said he had just been informed the students would be released on Thursday morning. Canadian officials said there were 28 students in the group, 22 of them Canadian.
Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon signaled Ottawa's displeasure with the Chinese action.
"We've delivered a diplomatic note to the Chinese foreign ministry and asked them to give us fulsome explanations as to why these individuals were quarantined, given the fact that there were no visible signs of any health problems," he told reporters in Parliament.
