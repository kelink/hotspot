(Reuters) - Japan's Fujifilm Holdings Corp (
) said it now aims for 120 billion yen ($1.3 billion) in sales in its digital camera operations in the current business year, rather than its original target of about 100 billion yen, as it is enjoying robust demand in emerging markets such as China. Fujifilm's digital camera operations may turn profitable at the operating level in the year to March 2010, compared with its original estimate of an operating loss, Fujifilm Corp Senior Vice President Takeshi Higuchi told Reuters in an interview.
Fujifilm Corp is a Fujifilm Holdings unit that handles cameras, photographic film, medical equipment and electronic components.
Fujifilm, the world's eighth-largest digital camera maker competing with larger rivals such as Canon Inc (
), aims to boost its digital camera sales to 12 to 13 million units next business year and to 15 million units in the year ending March 2013, Higuchi said on Friday.
