(Reuters) - Former world number one Ana Ivanovic has pulled out of this week's China Open and decided to end her 2009 season after suffering an upper respiratory tract infection.
The Serbian, now ranked 11th in the world, said she had been feeling ill since she arrived in Asia for the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo and the upgraded $4.5 million mandatory WTA event at Beijing's Olympic tennis center.
"I guess having to withdraw from Beijing is an appropriate ending to a very disappointing season," she said in a statement on Saturday.
"I am sorry to my supporters who were hoping to see me play here in Beijing. It's very disappointing for me as well, to come here, see the amazing facility they have and not have the energy to be able to step onto court."
"Instead of being patient and accepting that my best form was almost impossible due to physical limitations, I was always over-thinking things, and I never dealt with it very well," she added.
"The season was a continuation of going from one disappointment to another. If I had dealt better with these setbacks, I would have had a lot more success."
Ivanovic changed her service style after this year's Wimbledon tournament to protect her shoulder but was confident she could return to her old action when she resumes training next month.
"Despite my disappointments there is not a single doubt in my mind that I will reach the top again and win grand slams," she continued. "I have a lot to look forward to. Now is the time to rest, recharge, and come back stronger."
