Parker, ITW suggest healthier industrial economy

(Reuters) - A rebound in industrial markets, driven by restocking after a long recession and infrastructure spending by well-funded governments like China's, is again helping lift U.S. manufacturers' earnings.
Strength in industrial markets, which often lead economic recoveries as companies re-equip after a recession, supported profits in the latest quarter at diversified industrials Parker Hannifin Corp (
Both reported higher-than-expected profits and sales, and raised full-year earnings forecasts. Parker beat by a wide margin, and its shares jumped almost 5 percent. ITW stock fell almost 5 percent, however, amid a Deutsche Bank downgrade and disappointment with its acquisitions pace.
Government spending on infrastructure in China and other countries is driving demand for industrial products, said independent industrial analyst Brian Langenberg of Langenberg & Co, but expectations are high.
"There's real demand in markets where you're doing stuff with grid, you're doing stuff with roads," he said.
The trend could also mean strong results at other companies that sell into industrial markets, including Eaton Corp (
), Danaher Corp (
), which all report this week.
For demand to broaden out, especially in the United States, the regulatory and tax environment needs to become clearer. Investors are awaiting next month's elections and the potential for legislative gridlock. Late-cycle markets like commercial construction or capital spending to boost capacity will not pick up before late 2011, Langenberg added.
Industrial stocks have outperformed other sectors in recent months, largely because industrials have greater exposure to fast-growing emerging markets, said Michael Cuggino, president of the Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds, where holdings include ITW and Parker.
"They both make very unglamorous products that are necessary for economic activity," Cuggino said. "These companies give you an indication of the health of economic activity, because they're producing things that go into other products."
Parker, which makes motion control technology for manufacturing and aerospace, said profit tripled in the latest quarter. Its two industrial segments reported the strongest sales gains and increases in orders.
Among other industrial earnings, water heater and electric motor maker A.O. Smith Corp (
) beat estimates and raised its fiscal-year outlook, but said copper and steel prices were reason for caution. Shares fell 1.5 percent.
The world's top bearings maker, Sweden's SKF (
), raised its financial goals after forecast-beating earnings and its shares jumped to a record high.
) followed, adding almost 3 percent.
ITW, by contrast, showed that merely beating by earnings per share estimates by a penny is often not enough. ITW, whose products range from industrial and adhesives to kitchen equipment, reported improved demand from manufacturers for welding and packaging products.
Third-quarter profit rose to $419.3 million, or 83 cents a share, from $302.4 million, or 60 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 12 percent to $4.02 billion, slightly above estimates.
But ITW shares, which had outperformed peers ahead of its results, slumped, and analysts expressed disappointment with ITW's acquisition pace.
"Expectations were pretty high coming into the quarter," said Shane Sawyer, analyst at M&I Bank, whose Marshall Large-Cap Growth Fund owns ITW, General Electric Co (
), and Caterpillar Inc (
"It's going to be tough for people to meet market expectations," Sawyer said. Companies this earnings season often have to beat not just consensus estimates but also the so-called whisper number, which is typically higher.
Although ITW results were mixed, "one of the key takeaways that was a positive was their electronics business showed some pickup," said Chad Oviatt, portfolio manager of the Huntington Macro 100 fund, which owns ITW.
"Their late-stage businesses are showing some positive momentum," Oviatt said.
Oviatt said he wanted to see more details about ITW's acquisitions strategy. The company said on Tuesday such activity should improve this quarter and into 2011, after contributing only modestly to the most recent quarter.
