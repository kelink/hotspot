(Reuters) - Mining equipment maker Joy Global Inc JOYG.O is in talks to buy China's International Mining Machinery Holdings Ltd 1683.HK, a maker of coal-mining equipment, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
International Mining shares were suspended from trading on Monday in Hong Kong. The company, controlled by private equity firm Jordan Co LP, has a market value of HK$8.5 billion, or about $1.1 billion, according to Reuters data.
