Aegon, which received a capital injection of 3 billion euros from the Dutch government last October, said the sale was part of its strategy to optimize capital allocation and returns, but added that it still views Asia as an important growth market.
"We will continue to focus our attention on further developing Aegon's Asian platform, which includes our operations in China, India and Japan -- areas we believe offer significant growth and return prospects in the coming years," Chief Executive Alex Wynaendts said in a statement.
The sale will result in a total negative earnings impact of about 400 million euros in the second quarter, resulting in a charge of about 300 million euros to shareholders equity.
Aegon said it sold the business to Zhongwei, a holding company set up by the chairman of Meifu Development and the president of Taiwan Glass Industry.
