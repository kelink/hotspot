(Reuters) - Indonesia's state energy firm Pertamina said on Thursday it had agreed to buy BP's (
) stake in an offshore oil and gas block in West Java for $280 million, as it seeks to increase its upstream business.
BP had put up for sale a 46 percent stake in the Offshore North West Java (ONWJ) block, which Pertamina said currently produces 22,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd) and around 220 billion British thermal units of gas a day.
The oil major has said it wanted to sell its stake because the block did not fit in with the company's long-term strategy.
Pertamina's president said the firm would be the operator of the block and would fund the purchase using its own equity.
"Pertamina plans to increase the production of oil and gas from the block," Karen Agustiawan said at a signing ceremony.
Other major shareholders in ONWJ include China's CNOOC (
) with 36.72 percent and Japan's Inpex (
BP had previously said the sale would not affect BP's other interests in Indonesia, which include the $5 billion Tangguh liquefied natural gas project in Papua.
Pertamina has said it intends to expand its upstream activities to help boost oil and gas production, and was looking at several potential oil and gas fields in the country.
Last December, Pertamina said it was seeking a 30 percent stake in a gas field operated by Inpex in the Timor Sea. However, there has been no deal so far for Pertamina to participate in the field. (Reporting by Muklis Ali, Editing by Ed Davies and Ben Tan)
