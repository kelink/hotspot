Several of the largest industrial players hit or topped Wall Street's gloomy expectations on Tuesday by cutting tens of thousands of jobs, restructuring operations and scaling back projects.
But even so, while investors have sent stocks broadly higher in the past few weeks, the rest of 2009 still looks to be a pretty miserable time for the sector.
Conflicting outlooks provided a stark illustration of the uncertain direction of the world economy, which is still mired in a brutal recession.
On the plus side, Caterpillar Inc raised its 2009 profit target on Tuesday, saying the world economy was stabilizing. But fellow blue-chip industrial United Technologies Corp lowered its forecast and warned that next year might not bring a recovery.
Both companies reported second-quarter profit that topped Wall Street expectations, which investors said showed the payoff of their aggressive cost cutting.
"The manufacturing side of the economy probably suffered more of a decline than most of us expected in the second quarter, and it is not looking like it's rebounding yet," said Peter Sorrentino, senior vice president and portfolio manager at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati, which holds a stake in United Tech.
The shares of Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment, surged as much as 13 percent after it raised its profit forecast for the full year. United Tech, the world's top producer of elevators and air conditioners, saw its shares fall 1.7 percent after it cut the top end of its earnings outlook and its revenue forecast.
Both companies are still braced for sharp drops in profit. At its midpoint, Caterpillar's new forecast anticipates a plunge of more than 80 percent in per-share earnings, while United Tech expects a more modest 16 percent decline.
"We do not anticipate a significant economic recovery in 2010," said Greg Hayes, United Tech's chief financial officer. "We're still cautious about any kind of return to growth next year."
Caterpillar -- one of the first major U.S. companies to publicly forecast the severity of the downturn -- sees signs the economy may be bottoming out, its CEO said.
"There is still a great deal of economic uncertainty in the world," Chairman and Chief Executive Jim Owens said in a statement. "But we are seeing signs of stabilization ... Credit markets have improved significantly. Fiscal policy and monetary stimulus have been introduced around the world, and we are seeing signs, particularly in China, that they are beginning to work."
The Peoria, Illinois-based company reported $371 million in quarterly profit, down 67 percent from $1.11 billion a year earlier.
Factoring out the costs of more than 17,100 job cuts since the end of 2008, profit was 72 cents a share. On that basis, analysts had looked for just 22 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.
The company warned the third quarter, which has just begun, will be the weakest of the year.
Analysts attributed Caterpillar's strong performance to better-than-expected profit margins on its diesel engines and a lower-than-expected tax rate. Its machinery business -- which competes with Deere & Co, Terex Corp and Japan's Komatsu Ltd -- took an operating loss.
Hartford, Connecticut-based United Tech faces simultaneous downturns in its commercial construction and aviation markets.
The maker of Black Hawk military helicopters and Otis elevators said profit fell to $976 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, from $1.275 billion, or $1.32 per share, a year earlier. Analysts looked for $1.04 per share.
It lowered the top end of its full-year earnings forecast to $4.20 -- a step down from its prior $4 to $4.50 forecast -- but brought its view in line with Wall Street's $4.10 consensus, according to Reuters Estimates.
United Tech -- which has already unveiled restructuring plans that will eventually eliminate 18,000 jobs by the end of this year -- is counting on restructuring to drive profit growth next year.
"The expense control is very strong for all these companies, and that's the theme that is helping," said Peter Klein, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cleveland, Ohio, which holds positions in both companies.
Elsewhere in the industrial sector, filtration products maker Pentair Inc reported a 77 percent drop in profit that was deeper than Wall Street expected.
Caterpillar shares were up $3 at $39.65 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, off an earlier high of $41.45 and providing the biggest lift to the Dow Jones Industrial average. United Tech was off 92 cents at
Over the past 12 months, Caterpillar shares have fallen 53 percent and United Tech's are down 17 percent. The Dow, of which both are components, is down 23 percent.
"Expectations right now are pretty low," said Guaylon Arnic, materials analyst for Profit Investment Management, which has positions in industrial companies, including United Tech. "People will start to scrutinize earnings reports in the back half of the year much more closely."
