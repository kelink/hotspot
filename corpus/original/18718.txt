(Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama spoke with Chinese President Hu Jintao on Wednesday about global economic issues, concerns over North Korea and the issue of militants in Pakistan, the White House said in a statement.
"President Obama spoke with Chinese President Hu this morning and discussed ways to enhance cooperation on the global economy and health issues," the statement said, without giving further details.
The fifth incident of its kind in two months occurred on Friday in international waters about 170 miles from the Chinese mainland when the fishing vessels approached the USNS Victorious, U.S. defense officials said.
Obama hosted the leaders of Pakistan and Afghanistan at the White House on Wednesday, winning a fresh promise from them to work together to defeat al Qaeda.
Last month, the U.N. Security Council condemned North Korea's launch of what the United States and Japan said was a long-range missile but North Korea insisted was a rocket carrying a peaceful satellite.
This week North Korea's U.N. envoy dismissed a U.N. appeal that Pyongyang return to six-nation talks aimed at ending its nuclear program but did not fully rule out resuming negotiations at some time.
