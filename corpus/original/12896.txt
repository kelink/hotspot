LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Only 20 foreign-made films annually receive an official, revenue-sharing theatrical release in China, and this year the Nicolas Cage thriller "Knowing" is one of them.
State-owned China Film Group oversees annual legal film imports and controls the majority of foreign theatrical releases with Huaxia Film Distribution Co. The quota system favors films from the big Hollywood studios -- "Transformers," "Terminator Salvation," "Ice Age" and "Up" -- so the approval for "Knowing" is a coup for both DMG, a Chinese-American media company, and the film's independent studio, Summit.
Unlike the majors, Summit does not have offices in China, but its partner DMG used its knowledge of the Chinese marketplace and bureaucracy to position the film so as to nab one of the coveted spots.
The film's acceptance also is a testament to Cage's stature as an international draw and could be significant financially. For most U.S. movies released in China, their distributors receive a flat fee of $10,000 to $75,000. Under the CFG, studios receive a percentage of the gross, and with the Chinese box office growing at a speedy clip (2008's box office was $600 million, and this year it could reach $750 million), the windfall can be considerable.
"Knowing" will be released on 1,000-plus screens in the fall. Foreign films currently are not playing in the country because of a moratorium in conjunction with the anniversary of the country's Communist Party.
