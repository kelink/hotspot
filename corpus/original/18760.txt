UPDATE 2-Airbus cuts superjumbo delivery target
2009-05-06 11:32:00.0
(Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus cut its 2009 delivery target for A380 superjumbos on Wednesday, the latest in a series of cutbacks, this time blaming the economic crisis and deferral requests from airline customers.
Airbus now expects to deliver 14 of the double-decker planes, the world's largest airliners, down from its latest goal of 18.
Global airlines body IATA warned last week that swine flu would compound financial problems for airlines, already hit by the global economic crisis which pushed passenger numbers down 11.1 percent in March compared with a year ago.
The planemaker also gave a target for next year of more than 20 deliveries, but this is below most analysts' forecasts of at least 25 deliveries.
Subsequent delivery and production rates depended on airline demand and customer financing availability, Airbus said.
) shrugged off the news to rise 3 percent in line with a firmer market, buoyed by positive U.S. jobs data giving some respite from the economic gloom.
"Due to the current economic and aviation crisis and following specific customer requests for deferrals, Airbus is adapting its A380 aircraft delivery schedule for 2009/2010," the planemaker said.
The A380 is over two years behind schedule because of wiring installation problems, blamed for previous reductions to the delivery target. The company had reaffirmed its A380 schedule for this year as recently as a month ago. [ID:nL3155557]
Wednesday's announcement showed airline customers, many of whom had previously been compensated for production delays, are now being forced themselves to negotiate later delivery times because of the crisis hitting the aviation industry.
Airbus declined to identify the buyers of the four delayed aircraft in 2009 but at least one is likely to belong to Qantas, which said last month it would defer a total of four A380 orders as it announced 1,750 job cuts and issued a profit warning.

However, it said in March that it would stop flying the plane on its New York route because of the worldwide recession.
Airbus said it would take "mitigating actions" against the negative effects of the new A380 plan on free cash flow, but there would be no significant impact on operating income.
The planemaker, owned by aerospace group EADS (
), confirmed its plan, announced in February, to cut the production rate of its A320 aircraft family to 34 a month from 36 from October and said development of the new A350 XWB continued at "full speed". A330/340 production stands at 8.5 aircraft a month.
Airbus also confirmed its ambition to deliver about the same number of aircraft overall this year as in 2008, which was a record year for the company with 483 deliveries.
Chicago-based Boeing said last month output of its 777 wide-body twin-jet would fall to five planes a month from seven starting in June 2010, saying this would erode earnings.
World airlines are set to lose $4.7 billion this year as a result of the global downturn that has shrunk passenger and cargo demand, IATA estimated at the end of March. (Editing by Greg Mahlich)
