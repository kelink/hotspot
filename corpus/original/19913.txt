CAT CFO sees encouraging signs of life in China

(Reuters) - A top executive at Caterpillar Inc said on Tuesday he was seeing signs of a rebound in China and praised the focus and speed of that country's economic stimulus program.
In an interview with Reuters, Dave Burritt, the company's chief finance officer, also said Caterpillar employees deserved high marks for their work during the past quarter, as the construction and mining equipment maker moved aggressively to reduce inventories and bring its costs in line with fast-falling demand.
"Sometimes we get criticized for the execution," Burritt said. "There can be no criticism for this first quarter given the improvements in inventory at Caterpillar, the improvements in inventories at our dealer organization, our improvements in cost reduction."
His comments came as Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar reported its first loss in 17 years -- a loss driven by more than half a billion dollars in costs associated with recession-triggered layoffs -- and slashed its full-year earnings and sales forecast.
But stripping out the $558 million in layoff-related charges Caterpillar booked during the quarter, the company said it would have reported a profit of 39 cents a share -- well above the profit of 2 cents a share analysts expected on that basis.
Investors were apparently also impressed by Caterpillar's ability to expand margins even as sales of its distinctive yellow machines and engines tumbled 30 percent. After initially falling as much as 6.5 percent after the results were released, the shares rebounded and ended the day up 3 percent.
"Anecdotally, we see the pickup," Burritt said. "Some of our (Chinese) suppliers who were on three-day work weeks late in 2008 are now back to work five days and some are even working overtime."
He credited the Chinese government's efforts to revive that nation's economy for the recovery and contrasted the speed and emphasis of China's plan with those in the United States.
"They've done a great job with their stimulus package," Burritt said. "They've got a big piece of it based on infrastructure. We would have preferred a bigger infrastructure piece in the U.S. plan ... We're seeing action (in China) already. We're not seeing that much action on the U.S. package."
