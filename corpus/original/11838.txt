(Reuters) - U.S. stocks suffered their worst loss in seven weeks on Monday as weak data from Japan and a disappointing outlook from retailer Lowe's Cos (
) dampened hopes about the economy's growth.
Japan's gross domestic product showed its economy pulled out of recession in the second quarter, but at a slower pace than expected, prompting a sell-off in major Asian markets that spilled over into Europe and North America. For details, see [ID:nT212505]
Lowe's stock dropped 10.3 percent as the U.S. home improvement company gave investors few reasons to be positive about the outlook for the consumer.
The results amplified worries about weak consumer spending following last week's poor data on U.S. consumer sentiment and retail sales.
"The GDP number in Japan sort of got things started when it missed this morning," said Stephen Massocca, managing director of Wedbush Morgan in San Francisco.

U.S. selling was broad-based, but shares sensitive to the economy's cycles fell the most, including industrials .GSPI, down 2.9 percent, and financials .GSPF, down 4.3 percent. The Dow Jones index of home builders' shares .DJUSHB fell 3.3 percent.
