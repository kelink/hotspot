"We believe the focus of this meeting to come is to further revamp the international financial institutions so developing countries have a bigger say and better representation at international financial organizations," Yang told reporters on the sidelines of a regional meeting in the Thai resort of Phuket.
Brazil, India, Russia and China, collectively known as the BRIC countries, issued a joint communique in March calling for more lending to emerging economies hit by the collapse of private capital and for urgent reforms to improve their representation in the International Monetary Fund.
Intra-regional trade as well as investment and other forms of cooperation would continue to grow, he added.
"Of course, the developing countries, including China will also do their best."
