"We both want to see a prompt response from the Iranian regime in respect of the Tehran research reactor proposal," Miliband told reporters after talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow.
Under the U.S.-backed plan, Iran would send most of its low-enriched uranium (LEU) abroad for further processing to turn it into more refined fuel for a Tehran research reactor.
Iran's foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, said on Monday that Iran wants the IAEA to establish a committee to review the deal. He said Iran would continue enrichment for its nuclear needs.
Russia's Lavrov said he hoped Iran would approve the IAEA proposal.
He also called for a new meeting of major world powers -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- with Iran for talks about the Islamic Republic's nuclear programme.
"It should not simply be the latest meeting to discuss procedural questions but one at which a proper dialogue must take place on those proposals which the 3 plus 3 (powers) have made to Iran and taking into account those ideas which Iran has given to those proposals," Lavrov said.
