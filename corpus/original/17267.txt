2009-05-29 06:14:00.0
(Reuters) - The Agricultural Bank of China is set to open in New York and London, building a round-the-clock commodity trading team to further Beijing's ambition to be a major force on commodity markets.
Agbank will focus on trading in agricultural commodities and derivative products such as grain and corn, some of the few markets in which China is not a dominant player.
The world's biggest importer of soybeans, and several other key commodities, it trades very little wheat or corn, although many analysts expect it will eventually be forced to buy these goods abroad, a move that may trigger a buying frenzy in the Chicago trading pits. Here is some data showing China's rapid ascent through the ranks of global importers to top commodity tables. ************************************************************
