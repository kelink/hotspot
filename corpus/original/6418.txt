U.S., Taiwan researching new arms sales despite China

(Reuters) - U.S. officials are studying new weapon sales to Taiwan despite near certain outrage from China, the island president told local media, a move that could further strain ties between the two superpowers.
Taiwan and the United States, the island's staunchest informal ally and a regular seller of arms for defense against China, are studying new systems in addition to a $6.4 billion package announced earlier in the year, President Ma Ying-jeou told the semi-official Central News Agency.
Any new sales, the details of which Taiwan's presidential office declined to give, would worry markets by straining ties again between the world's two biggest economies as Beijing accused Washington of meddling in a domestic dispute.
China claims sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan and has aimed at least 1,000 missiles its way, the island government says. U.S. officials have said Taiwan needs to shore up its defense, seen lagging China's, to negotiate trade issues with Beijing on equal footing after decades of hostilities.
"Otherwise, facing 1,000 missiles, it's hard to go negotiate with mainland China, and the mainland understands that," Ma was quoted saying in the Friday Central News Agency report.
Taiwan's Defense Ministry is working on a wish list for the U.S. side, the president's office told Reuters.
A long-standing Taiwan request for U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets described as a "red line" for China remains on the table, the news agency said.
