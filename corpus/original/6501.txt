(Reuters) - China's foreign ministry said on Tuesday there was still room for a negotiated solution to Iran's disputed nuclear program, despite talks among major powers of fresh sanctions against Tehran.
China has been among the six countries, also called the "5+1," engaged in deepening discussions on a proposed new round of United Nations Security Council sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program.
China, a veto-holding permanent member of the Security Council, has been wary of backing new sanctions on Iran, arguing that they do not work and fearful of damaging its extensive ties with the major oil supplier.
"We have stated many times that the six countries launching the talks in New York does not mean that the door is shut to dialogue and negotiations," she said, referring to the five permanent Security Council members, plus Germany.
"We have always believed that dialogue and negotiations are the best channels for resolving the Iran nuclear issue," Jiang added.
Diplomats told Reuters last week that China's envoy at the UN headquarters in New York had indicated displeasure at sanctions proposals affecting Iran's energy sector.
