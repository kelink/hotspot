(Reuters) - China's Jilin Jien (
), whose bid for Canadian Royalties CZZ.TO is facing opposition from certain investors, said it will not increase or extend its offer to buy the early-stage Canadian miner.
Jien Canada, the JV formed by Jilin Jien and Canada's Goldbrook Ventures GBK.V for the takeover, said it will not take up shares or debentures tendered to its offer, if it fails to meet the minimum tender conditions by the expiry date of Nov. 10.
Jien Canada, which is offering 80 Canadian cents for each Canadian Royalties share and C$800 for each C$1,000 debenture, said its offers were full and final and it will allow its offers to expire.
A group of investors, led-by merchant bank Jaguar Financial (
) are looking to block the deal, seeking premium a over debentures held by them.
Shares of Canadian Royalties were trading flat at 64 Canadian cents Thursday morning on the Toronto Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Ashutosh Joshi in Bangalore; Editing by Pradeep Kurup)
