Aug 10 (Reuters) - A conditional offer by New Zealand on Monday to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by between 10 and 20 percent by 2020 is slightly deeper than the average promised by all industrialised nations, Reuters calculations show.
Total reductions by industrialised nations, including the United States, members of the European Union and Russia, average between 10 and 14 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. The overall numbers are unchanged by the addition of New Zealand.
New Zealand's offer comes with strings including a demand for a "comprehensive" U.N. climate accord in Copenhagen in December. By contrast, the EU has promised a unilateral 20 percent cut by 2020 and 30 percent if others follow suit.
Negotiators from 180 nations are meeting in Bonn, Germany, from Aug. 10-14 for talks on the new climate pact meant to avert more floods, droughts, heatwaves, stronger storms and rising sea levels.
Many developing states led by China and India want rich nations, which have emitted most greenhouse gases since the Industrial Revolution, to cut by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020.
Under a planned U.N. deal, developing nations are due to slow the rise of their emissions by 2020. Poor nations say they need to burn more energy to help end poverty.
