(Reuters) - Kaisun Energy Group (
), a Hong Kong-based holding company, said on Thursday that it will buy out a Russian oilfield company, Nobel Holdings Investments, invested in by China Investment Corp [CIC.UL].
Nobel Holdings is 45 percent owned by CIC, China's $298 billion sovereign wealth fund, 5 percent by Hong Kong-based Oriental Patron Financial Group and 50 percent by integrated petroleum company Nobel Oil.
Last month, the three joint venture partners signed an agreement under which CIC and Oriental Patron said they would provide $300 million to develop Nobel Oil's oilfields in Russia's Komi Republic, according to Interfax.
The company would issue new shares to fund the acquisition, Joseph Chan, chairman of Kaisun Energy, told reporters.
Nobel Holdings owns all of the assets of Nobel Oil in Russia, comprising three producing oil fields with a combined production capacity of 150 million barrels of oil.
"This proposed acquisition is a golden opportunity to tap the international oil and gas industry," Chan said.
"Since our corporate repositioning, we have been embarking on a value-driven acquisition strategy to develop ourselves into an integrated resources company," he added.
The deal is expected to be completed in January 2010, Chan said.
