(Reuters) - Ping An Insurance (Group) Co of China Ltd (
), the world's No. 2 life insurer by market value, posted a 34 percent jump in second-quarter earnings as China's stock market boom boosted investment returns.
Net profit attributable to shareholders during the April-June period rose to 3.2 billion yuan ($468 million) from 2.39 billion yuan a year earlier, based on international accounting standards.
The quarterly results, calculated from half-year figures, marked a sharp turnaround from a 71 percent slump in first-quarter earnings and a 99 percent tumble in 2008 profit.
) have benefited from a 60 percent jump in China's stock market during the first half of the year, as the world's third-biggest economy began to bounce back with the aid of a massive raft of government stimulus spending.
"In the second half of 2009, we will further refine our investment strategies," Ping An said in a statement. "(We) will further expand our investment channels and extend non-capital market investments to achieve long-term and stable investment returns."
In the first half, the company increased equity investment to 9.6 percent of the total from 7.8 percent, while cutting the proportion of fixed-income investments to 74.7 percent from 80.7 percent.
For the first half, however, Ping An's net profit slumped 46 percent to 5.2 billion yuan from 9.5 billion yuan a year earlier, exceeding the 32 percent fall predicted by six analysts polled by Reuters.
Based on domestic accounting standards, first-half profit fell 38.8 percent to 4.35 billion yuan.
Ping An attributed the slump in first-half profit to a decrease in the direct profit contribution from realised equity investment gains, rising costs associated with a surge in premium income, and tax provisions.
Ping An said in June it would buy out Newbridge Capital's stake in Shenzhen Development Bank (
) as part of Chairman Peter Ma's ambition to build the insurer into a financial conglomerate. [ID:nLC811874]
Ping An's shares fell 0.69 percent to HK$65.1 in Hong Kong on Friday ahead of the results. The stock has jumped 68 percent this year, compared with a 45 percent gain in the benchmark Hang Seng Index
