(Reuters) - Mexico's peso currency sank in early trading on Monday on worries the swine flu outbreak could further hobble Mexico's already battered economy, traders said.
weakened 3.14 percent to 13.715 per U.S. dollar before the local market's open.
fell on Monday as concerns intensified that the spread of swine flu, which has killed more than 100 people in Mexico, would hit the global economy.
"Cases do seem to be popping up across continents and people seem to be taking it quite seriously. Since Mexico seems to be where it all started, there is some medium-term impact particularly related to tourism," said Beat Siegenthaler, head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities in London.
"But it is too early to say that it could have a major economic impact," Siegenthaler said.
A prolonged epidemic could hit Mexico's $13 billion-a-year tourism industry and weigh on already weak retail sales as Mexicans frightened by the flu stay home.
The European Union's health chief advised travelers on Monday not to go to areas affected by swine flu, but the EU did not issue any formal instructions to travelers.
Finance Minister Agustin Carstens said on Sunday the impact of the flu on Mexico's economy would be "transitory" but warned it could have an "important impact." (Reporting by Michael O'Boyle; Editing by James Dalgleish)
