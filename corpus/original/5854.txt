Ambow shares opened at their $10 IPO price, but closed down 75 cents at $9.25 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.
The company sold 10,677,207 American Depositary Shares for $10 each on Wednesday, raising about $107 million. It had planned to sell the shares at $10 to $12 each.
The shares of Gordmans, which raised about $58.9 million in its IPO, opened at their $11 IPO price and then rose as high as $11.99 before closing at $11.03 -- up 3 cents on the Nasdaq.
Omaha, Nebraska-based Gordmans sells clothing and household goods for as much as 60 percent off and had 68 stores as of June 4. Net sales rose 19.7 percent to $111.9 million in the 13 weeks ended May 1 compared with a year earlier. Net income rose 75.5 percent to $6.4 million in the same period.
Ambow established regional hubs in 2008 by buying K-12 schools, tutoring centers, colleges and career centers. It is trying to take advantage of higher disposable income and the hiring needs of companies doing business in China.

The company's net revenue grew 47.6 percent to 260.3 million yuan ($38.4 million) in the three months ended March 31. Net income fell 81.8 percent to just under 3 million yuan in the same period.
