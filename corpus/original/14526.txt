(Reuters) - Draft statements being prepared for issue at meetings of G8 leaders and G8 leaders plus G5 emerging market economies have no direct reference to currency or foreign exchange, according to the draft texts obtained by Reuters.
The texts, as updated following discussions among officials Tuesday night, are being drafted for publication at meetings Wednesday of leaders of the G8 economic powers and Thursday of those leaders plus G5 leaders from countries such as China, India, Brazil and Mexico.
The meetings taking place in L'Aquila, Italy, are being closely watched by some in financial markets because China has asked for a debate on global reserve currencies and argues there should be a shift over time away from a global financial system dependent solely on the U.S. dollar in that regard.
It notes signs of stabilization in the economy, including recovery in stock markets, and says that governments are committed to return to sustainable public finance in the medium term.
On that, the draft says:
"Stable and sustainable long-term growth will require a smooth unwinding of the existing imbalances in current accounts," says the draft.
