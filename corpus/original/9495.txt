(Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei average ended flat near a three-week high in thin trade on Wednesday, as chip-linked shares such as Advantest Corp (
Japan Airlines Corp 9205.T extended this week's rebound after a newspaper said a government-appointed task force would seek to double a proposed capital boost for the struggling carrier, helping it to erase a drop of around 25 percent in value made last week.
The benchmark Nikkei moved in a tight range throughout the day as investors wait for Japan's earnings season, which will swing into full gear next week.
"After solid U.S. quarterly earnings, the focus is now on Japanese corporate earnings -- their first half results and the outlooks for the second half of the business year," said Masaru Hamasaki, senior strategist at Toyota Asset Management.
"Attention is on whether investors can confirm expectations that earnings are really improving on the back of measures such as cost cuts. If reports come within expectations, the market could move higher."

U.S. stocks retreated from 12-month highs on Tuesday. New construction of U.S. homes rose less than expected in September, and U.S. producer prices posted an unexpected decline, raising concerns about the pace of economic recovery. [ID:nN20424995]
But analysts warned about making too much of the data, noting that global markets have been ripe for profit-taking after recent gains helped take them far from March lows. Even the Nikkei, a relative laggard, has risen nearly 50 percent.
"Investors need to see fresh economic data for more clues about the outlook for the economy," said Kazuhiro Takahashi, general manager at Daiwa Securities SMBC.
"If data that miss expectations keep emerging, that would dampen investor confidence. But this time around it wasn't as if the U.S. housing data pointed to a downward trend."
Other economic indicators in focus include China's GDP figures for the third quarter, which are due on Thursday, with economists polled by Reuters expecting year-on-year growth of 8.9 percent. [ID:nPEK194184]
