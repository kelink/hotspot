(Reuters)- The yuan touched a record high against the dollar on Tuesday, as the People's Bank of China set a new peak for the mid-point for the fourth straight session after the dollar index fell to a three-week low.
Before trade began, the PBOC set the yuan's daily mid-point at a record high of 6.4845 against the dollar, from Monday's 6.4856.
Spot yuan hit a fresh peak of 6.4780 versus the dollar in late trade before closing at 6.4791 compared with Monday's close of 6.4829.
The Chinese currency has now appreciated 5.36 percent since it was depegged from the dollar in June 2010, and 1.71 percent since the start of this year.
In nominal terms, the yuan has risen only 0.2 percent this month, less than gains of 0.9 percent in April and 0.4 rise in March, respectively.
But as the dollar index .DXY against a basket of six major currencies dominated by the euro was up more than 2 percent in May, the yuan's value against a China trade-weighted basket of currencies could in fact be boosted more than its value against the dollar, traders said.
"We see the trend for the yuan to continue to rise against the dollar for the rest of this year," said a dealer at a Chinese commercial bank in Shenzhen, retaining a forecast for the yuan to appreciate 5 to 6 percent for all of 2011.
Offshore, one-year non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) were bid at 6.3575, little changed from 6.3600 at Monday's close. Their implied yuan appreciation in a year's time was 2.0 percent.
