FACTBOX: China's new fuel specs vs Euro standards
2009-11-20 08:42:00.0
(Reuters) - China will start using cleaner gasoline and automotive diesel from January 2010, with specifications similar to Euro III standards introduced a decade ago in the West.
For gasoline, the standards were in place since December 2006, but are only becoming mandatory nationwide from January 2010.
For diesel, China is launching automotive diesel specifications for the first time, to differentiate from diesel used by the rural, marine and industrial sectors.
The diesel specs, however, will not become a national mandate until June 2011, China's Standardisation Administration has said.
China, keen to clean up the skies as the world's third-largest economy expands rapidly, aims to catch up with European fuel quality, now in Euro V standards, by 2015/16, a researcher with the Ministry of Environmental Protection said.

WHO PUSHES NEW FUEL STANDARDS?
Regulatory wise, China's Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) is the entity that trumpets and pushes for the formulation of cleaner fuel standards.
The National Standardisation Administration approves and publishes them, while top refiner Sinopec Corp has taken the role of mapping out the specifications.
But the oil duopoly, Sinopec and PetroChina, both have lobbying power to influence the timing and speed for shifts to greener fuel.
The country's quality watchdog, the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, supervises the executions through routine checks on petrol stations.
The following lists the main features of China's new fuel specs versus European ones.
-- sulphur max 350 ppm, vs previous 500 ppm or 2000 ppm
-- distillation cuts: 50 pct recovery, max temp 300 degree Celsius
90 pct recovery, max temp 355
95 pct recovery, max temp 365

Notes: European product specifications are classified as Euro II for specs before year 2000, Euro III for product specs in 2000, Euro IV for the 2005 specs and Euro V for specs effective Jan 2009 through 2014.
