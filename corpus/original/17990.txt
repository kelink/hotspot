(Reuters) - China's top Internet search company Baidu Inc (
Spokeswoman Sun Yao said all staff were back at work on Tuesday, adding that previous problems were the result of miscommunication. She declined to elaborate.
More than 200 workers joined the strike in China's southern Shenzhen, and the dispute was escalated to the city's labour department, workers outside Baidu's office told Reuters.
"Operations are more or less back to normal now," one worker said, adding he was not one of the people who had gone on strike. "We can't say much because they're still in talks."
Some staff had refused to work since May 4, and on Friday employees in the Shenzhen office filed a complaint with the labour bureau, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.
Baidu cut sales agents' base salaries by about 30 percent from 4,000 yuan ($590), raised sales targets, threatened to withhold commissions and dismiss sales agents who failed to meet the targets, the paper cited anonymous employees as saying.
Similar actions were taken by strikers at Baidu's office in nearby Guangzhou, according to other media reports.
Like other media firms, Baidu has been hit by a downturn in advertising sales, one of its main revenue sources. In February, the company reported its first sequential quarterly sales decline since its IPO in the United States in 2005.
