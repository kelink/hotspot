(Reuters) - European shares rose in early trade on Friday, with Rio Tinto (
) leading miners higher after scrapping a planned tie-up with Chinalco, and energy companies rising on higher crude prices.
At 0710 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300
index of top European shares was up 0.6 percent at 871.75 points. Rio Tinto rose 9.5 percent, more than reversing Thursday's 6.6 percent decline, after it announced a deeply discounted $15.2 billion rights issue, and scrapped plans for a tie-up with China's Chinalco [ID:nSYD73514].
"Before when Rio was stuck in a debt bind, risk aversion was high, they couldn't get the money," said Bernard McAlinden, investment strategist at NCB Stockbrokers, in Dublin. "But now, the shareholders are willing to put up the money and they can avoid the dilution there would have been with Chinalco."
Other miners rose, with copper prices near their highest in more than seven months. BHP Billiton (
), which will increase its stake in a joint venture with Rio, rose 10.6 percent.
), Antofagasta (
Oil producers rose after the price of crude CLc1 settled at $68.81 a barrel in New York on Thursday, its highest close since Nov. 4.
), BP (
) rose between 1.2 and 2.8 percent. Later in the day, investor focus will switch to the non-farm payroll data in the United States, with the rate of job losses expected to decline.
"The market is vulnerable to any suggestion that the economic recovery is not on track," said McAlinden. (Reporting by Brian Gorman)
