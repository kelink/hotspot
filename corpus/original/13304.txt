FACTBOX: Moldova's acting president Voronin

(Reuters) - Moldova's outgoing President Vladimir Voronin, who intends to stay in politics despite stepping down, heads the Communist party's list in an early parliamentary election set for July 29.
* Voronin, 68, was born into a farming family. After graduating from a Chisinau vocational school, he became the director of a bakery in a rural district.
He later rose through the ranks of the Soviet Communist Party, becoming Moldovan Interior Minister in 1989-90.
* In 1989, pro-Romanian protesters clashed with police before ransacking Voronin's ministry. He chose not to deploy Soviet Interior Ministry troops against the demonstrators. Voronin drew a parallel with those events in addressing the government last April, after protesters sacked his offices and the parliament building following an election which the opposition said was rigged to favor the Communists.
* Voronin's Communist Party won the parliamentary election in 2001 and he was elected president by the assembly after promising better ties with Moscow.
By the 2005 election, the president advocated bringing Moldova closer to Europe. He turned against Moscow and accused it of helping separatists in the Russian-speaking Transdniestria region, which broke away in 1990.
* Most of Moldova was once part of Romania and the two countries share an ethnic, cultural and historic heritage. Under Voronin, ties between the two countries worsened after the Moldovan leader complained that Romania hoped to absorb Moldova.
* Voronin's second -- and last -- four-year term has expired, but the parliament formed in April twice failed to elect his hand-picked successor. That led to the dissolution of the chamber by presidential decree and an early election.
Voronin has since been elected speaker of parliament. Some analysts suggest he would like to exercise power from that position in a manner similar to Russia's Vladimir Putin, now prime minister after stepping down as president.
