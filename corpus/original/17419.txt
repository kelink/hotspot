(Reuters) - Trading in Spain's Dogi (
) was suspended on Wednesday after the textile maker said it had filed for administration, having failed to obtain financing.
Dogi, which makes stretch fabrics and specialises in lingerie, swimwear and sportswear, is the first listed Spanish company to file for administration outside the real estate sector.
"The administration filing will not interrupt Dogi's normal operations," the company said, adding that its management was working on a viability plan.
Other group units abroad were not involved in the process and were working as normal, it added.
In addition to its El Masnou factory in Spain with 590 employees, Dogi also has factories in Germany, Thailand, China and the Philippines.
"After several quarters of losses and various strategic plans on the table, strong competition in Asia and the global crisis have toppled the company's goal to increase profitability and become self-sufficient in cash flow," Banesto Bolsa analysts said in a note.
Its shares last traded on Tuesday at 0.64 euros, valuing the company at about 41 million euros. ($1=.7158 Euro) (Reporting by Tomas Gonzalez, Judy MacInnes, Tracy Rucinski; editing by Will Waterman)
