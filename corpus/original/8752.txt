1) CHINA (annual emissions: 6.8 billion metric tons, 5.5 metric tons per capita)
2) UNITED STATES (6.4 billion metric tons, 21.2 metric tons per capita)
* Demands - "We cannot meet this challenge unless all the largest emitters of greenhouse gas pollution act together," Obama said.
3) EUROPEAN UNION (5.03 billion metric tons, 10.2 metric tons per capita)
4) RUSSIA (1.7 billion metric tons, 11.9 metric tons per capita)
* Emissions - President Dmitry Medvedev said in June that Russia's emissions would be around 10 to 15 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. That means a rise from now -- emissions were 34 percent below 1990 levels in 2007.
5) INDIA (1.4 billion metric tons, 1.2 metric tons per capita)
* Emissions - India is prepared to quantify the amount of greenhouse gas emissions it could cut with domestic actions, but will not accept internationally binding targets, Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh said on September 17. India has said its per capita emissions will never rise to match those of developed nations.
* Demands - Like China, India wants rich nations to cut emissions by at least 40 percent by 2020. But Ramesh signaled room to compromise on October 16: "It's a negotiation. We've given a number of 40 percent but one has to be realistic."
6) JAPAN (1.4 billion metric tons, 11.0 metric tons per capita)
* Emissions - Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama wants to cut Japan's emissions by 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 if Copenhagen agrees an ambitious deal, toughening a goal set by the previous government of an eight percent reduction.
(Note: Greenhouse gas emissions are 2008 data by Germany's Energy industry institute IWR except EU, which are from 2007 submission to United Nations)
