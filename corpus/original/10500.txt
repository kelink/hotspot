UPDATE 2-LNG supplies seen tight from 2015 on delays -Qatar

(Reuters) - The postponement of planned natural gas liquefaction facilities amid the current global slump in gas prices will lead to tight supplies by 2015, a senior Qatari LNG official said on Tuesday.
Faisal Al-Suwaidi, the chief executive of Qatargas, told the World Natural Gas conference that LNG consuming nations needed to prepare themselves for the coming tight supply situation.
"Fewer greenfield and brownfield projects are advancing," Al-Suwaidi said, adding that the global gas industry had to avoid past errors and keep investing in new capacity to meet long term demand.
) Chief Executive Antonio Brufau said earlier on Tuesday that global LNG markets would likely be in surplus until 2013, which could prompt state energy companies to deliberately restrict supplies to prop up prices.
However, Al-Suwaidi, head of one the world's biggest LNG producers, was sceptical that producers would cut back on production in the face of falling demand. "I doubt whether this will happen," he told journalists on Tuesday.
Growing demand from India and China has made up for drops in demand from traditional large importers Japan and South Korea this year, helping balance the market, he said.
And, while short term LNG prices have been pressured by falling demand, Al-Suwaidi said, in the long term prices will rebound.
The Qatargas joint ventures could quickly increase production capacity by about 12 million tonnes per year once a moratorium on new LNG projects in the country is lifted, Al-Suwaidi said.
Qatar imposed a moratorium on new LNG projects at its giant North Field in 2003, saying it needed time to study how the reservoir responded to higher production levels.
The moratorium allows total production in Qatar of up to 77 million tonnes of LNG, a level Qatar expects to reach by the end of 2010. (Reporting by Ed McAllister and Robert Campbell; Editing by Walter Bagley)
