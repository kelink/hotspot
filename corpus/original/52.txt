How exactly does facebook ¡®lift U.S. stocks.¡¯ ?? They supply nothing. And they don¡¯t order supplies from other companies. They are not in a supply chain at all. Their relative success or failure would appear to have no impact on other companies. Whatsoever. No? What are they going to do with their cash that would ¡®lift¡¯ other companies, order up 300 million smiley face emoticons from an Amazon warehouse in Cleveland? This is facebook, folks. Investors have gotten stupid, I guess. Facebook ripple effect. Good one.
