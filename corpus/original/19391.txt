ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR:
"California's biggest problem, besides the huge budget problem we have, is water."
On swine flu: "I want you to know that the best minds in California are working on this. And when I say the best minds in California, that automatically means the best minds in the world."
ADRIANNE SHAPIRA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, RETAIL ANALYST, GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO:
"You really have to work very hard to pry that discretionary dollar out of the consumer's wallet."
Consumers are shifting "from aspirational to desperational. We've come off a period where people were trading up."
MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, CEO AND CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, PIMCO:
"We are so focused on whether the recovery will be at the end of this year or next year that we may lose sight of something more consequential. We are not going to go back to where we were before. What does the new normal look like? It is unambiguous that we are going to a new normal."
KENNETH GRIFFIN, FOUNDER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CITADEL INVESTMENT GROUP:
STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, FORBES INC and EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FORBES MAGAZINE:
MARK YUSKO, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, MORGAN CREEK CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:
ROBERT KELLY, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORP (
CHRISTOPHER AILMAN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CALIFORNIA STATE TEACHERS' RETIREMENT SYSTEM:
"While it's nice to see the (stock) market rally and see all these 'green shoots', especially around the consumer, there is still so much leverage that needs to unwind ... There is still such a tremendous load of debt in front of us."
MICHAEL MILES, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, STAPLES (
"It was a full cardiac arrest in the fourth quarter ... realistically, there was not a lot of lending going on."
"We're finding there is much more fertile ground on the Internet than there is in some of the traditional mass communications vehicles. We rely heavily at Staples, in our retail business, on the Sunday circular and put a huge percentage of our marketing dollars to that channel. What we're finding ... is that we can do a lot more effective job directing people to our Website and to the online circular."
"We're the No. 2 online retailer after Amazon.com ... and we're still finding that we're on elementary school-level of really doing a good job of marketing on the Internet."
JIM GOODNIGHT, CEO of SAS, A BUSINESS ANALYTICS COMPANY:
"There is money out there ... but you've got to prove that you don't need it."
MICHAEL BOSKIN, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION:
DAVID E. SIMON, CHAIRMAN and CEO, SIMON PROPERTY GROUP (
Asked how many of the 1,200 U.S. malls could close, he said: "It takes a long time for malls to die. I think in this environment the obsolescence will accelerate, so instead of a 10-year cycle for a mall to go bad, it's going to be one or two years if not even faster."
"The retailer is focused on (lowering) expenses and I'm focused on collecting rent. It's a wonderful match that's transpriring right now," he joked.
DELOS COSGROVE, CLEVELAND CLINIC CEO:
"Obesity ... is protected by Americans with Disabilities Act, which sends -- to me -- a little bit of the wrong message about what obesity is and what it represents." (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss, Lisa Baertlein and Jim Christie, editing by Bernie Woodall, Bernard Orr)
