China exam result "stolen" for official's daughter
Wed  EDT
(Reuters Life!) - A Chinese police official has been arrested for stealing another girl's exam results and passing it off as his daughter's to ensure her a place in college, a newspaper said on Wednesday.
Competition for college places is fierce in China where stories of cheating surface every year. Students pay for leaked exam papers, smuggle in mobile phones and electronic dictionaries, or pay others to take the exam for them.
Wang Zhengrong, formerly of the Public Security Bureau in Shaodong county in the southern province of Hunan, was charged with forging and altering official documents and seals in 2004, the China Youth Daily said.
He passed off the identity information and exam results of a village girl, his daughter's classmate, as those of his daughter who had failed the National Examination for College Entrance.
The scam was uncovered when the village girl found she couldn't apply for a credit card as her ID number belonged to someone else, the newspaper said.
The story has become a hot topic on Chinese websites, infuriating many bloggers. "Did they ever think about the future of that country girl and her desperation?" one asked. "Is there any social justice in China?"
