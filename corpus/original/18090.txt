Yangtze Power, whose shares have been suspended from trade for more than a year pending a restructuring scheme, will issue 1.55 billion shares to its parent in a private placement for 12.89 yuan each, raising 20 billion yuan, and pay 37.5 billion yuan in cash in the acquisition scheme.
The company, which operates the Three Gorges Dam in China's southwest, will receive the 18 of the 26 Three Gorges generating units it does not already own.
The acquisition will boost its installed generating capacity to two-and-a-half times its current level, and increase its 2009 net profit to 6.3 billion yuan from last year's 3.93 billion yuan, the company estimated.
Yangtze Power's shares, suspended since May 8 of last year, will resume trade on Monday.
