(Reuters) - Photovoltaic cell maker Solarfun Power Holdings Co Ltd SOLF.O posted a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss as raw material prices fell, sending its shares up as much as 13 percent.
"The main driver behind the results was the company's ability to get raw material prices down," Simmons & Co analyst Burt Chao told Reuters.
The analyst said Solarfun was benefiting from a drop in prices as it did not have a secure polysilicon position, unlike companies with fixed contracts.
The company said for 2009, price levels for more than 70 percent of its polysilicon and wafer requirements will be determined based on prevailing market conditions. Polysilicon prices on the spot market are currently below $70 per kilogram, it added.
In the fourth quarter, Solarfun, along with China Sunergy Co Ltd (
), Canadian Solar Inc (
) got squeezed by a drop in inventory value, forcing these companies to take write-downs.
Chao expects, at a minimum, flat gross margin across the year, with some sequential growth, quarter over quarter.
For the first quarter, the company posted a loss of $1 million, or 2 cents per American depositary share (ADS), down from a year-ago net profit of $15.8 million.
Analysts, on average, were expecting a loss of 17 cents a share, excluding items, on revenue of $100.1 million, according to Reuters Estimates.
The company's shares, which were among the highest percentage gainers Tuesday on Nasdaq, were trading up 60 cents at $5.67 in afternoon trade.
Excluding Tuesday's gains, the stock is so far off about 83 percent from a May 2008 peak of $29.17. (Reporting by Adveith Nair and Sakthi Prasad in Bangalore; Editing by Himani Sarkar, Anil D'Silva)
