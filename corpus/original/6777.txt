(Reuters) - North Korea has allowed Swedish diplomats to visit a U.S. citizen detained nearly two months ago after allegedly entering the country from China, the U.S. State Department said on Monday.
"We can confirm that on March 14 the DPRK (Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea) granted the Swedish embassy, our protecting power, consular access to a detained U.S. citizen," said State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley.
The United States said in January that North Korea had informed it that it was holding the American, but since then has provided no information about the case.
North Korea's official news agency said the American was detained after crossing into its territory from China, accusing him of "trespassing" and saying he was under interrogation.
North Korea in February released another detained American, clearing an obstacle between Pyongyang and Washington as pressure mounts for North Korea end its year-long boycott of talks aimed at ending its nuclear program.
Robert Park, identified as a U.S. missionary, was detained after he walked over the frozen Tumen river from China into North Korea on December 25 on what he said was a mission to raise awareness about Pyongyang's human rights abuses.
