The Swiss bank is targeting 35 to 45 billion Swiss francs in new client money between now and end-2012, adding to the 62 billion Swiss francs ($60.3 billion) in Asian assets under management it had at the end of June, Asia Pacific head of private banking Marcel Kreis said on Wednesday.
"This year, we've added over 20 senior bankers and we'll continue to add to our team... We really haven't missed a beat throughout the crisis," he told the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit in Singapore.
In Asia, the bank has continued to hire experienced private bankers despite the downturn and its recent recruits include UBS (
) veteran Tee Fong Seng who is now Credit Suisse's vice chairman for Asia Pacific private banking.
Credit Suisse, which attracted 5.5 billion Swiss francs in net new assets in Asia in the first half of 2009, currently has around 400 relationship managers in Asia.
Kreis said Credit Suisse is keen to further grow its presence in China and may consider setting up onshore operations in Taiwan, following the establishment of domestic businesses in Australia, China, Japan and Indonesia over the past three years.
He added that Singapore and Hong Kong will remain key offshores centers for private banking, despite the move by Credit Suisse and other private banks to establish onshore operations, as the region's two key financial centers offer a range of services that are not available elsewhere.
"We need to speak to clients about re-deploying this cash. Without the threat of imminent inflation, rates are unlikely to move up soon," he said.
"There's lots of liquidity around a lot of private banks, and clients who felt they missed the first wave (of the market rally) will definitely want to commit more cash into the market."
