(Reuters) - China's annual GDP growth quickened to 7.9 percent in the second quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Thursday.
First-half growth had laid a solid foundation for hitting the government's full-year growth target of 8 percent.
"We see more people shopping and prices beginning to rise. The economy is recovering and the recovery is intensifying. All the government's policies have worked together to help us overcome the financial crisis."
"Policies to maintain growth have achieved very clear results, but the foundation for recovery is still not solid."
"Currently, prices are still falling, overall demand is still weak and economic growth is below potential. Some industries still face overcapacity and the capacity utilization is still low."
"Though the economy is recovering, it is still unable to create enough jobs. We are facing serious pressure and the central government has particularly stressed the need to implement active employment policies."
"To do quarter-on-quarter statistics is difficult, requiring more data collection. We are studying from abroad about how to do this but it will still take time to learn."
"Summer grain output has been on the rise for six consecutive years. As we know, prices are closely related to grain supply in China."
"Since the start of this year, international raw material prices have been rising, which has had a certain impact on China's prices ... We should see that the month-on-month industrial factory-gate prices have been on the rise in the past three months."
"Prices and credit growth do have a very close relationship, they are in direct proportion, so we should keep a close eye on bank lending."
