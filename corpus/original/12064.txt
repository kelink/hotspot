(Reuters) - Thailand's leading satellite operator, Thaicom PCL THCOM.BK, said on Thursday it expected to launch a high-speed Internet service in India via its broadband satellite IPSTAR in the second half of this year.
The company should start booking revenue from the Indian market in the fourth quarter, and an IPSTAR service in China should be relaunched soon, Chief Financial Officer Tanadit Charoenchan told reporters.
The Indian market, accounting for about 17 percent of IPSTAR's capacity, is the second largest after China, where operations have stalled.
But Thaicom has already made an agreement with new partner China Telecom, which should help stimulate revenue growth in the second half of 2009, Tanadit said.
Thaicom, which reported a net loss of 22 million baht in the first half of 2009, maintained its forecast that it would return to net profit thanks to revenue from the Indian and Chinese markets, he said.
His forecast was better than market expectations, as analysts expect Thaicom to post a 2009 net loss in the range of of 90-190 million baht versus a 713 million baht loss in 2008.
The company reported a net profit of 199 million baht in the second quarter, a turnaround from a net loss of 282 million baht a year earlier. [ID:nBKK526905]
The $400 million IPSTAR, launched in August 2005, had been expected to drive earnings at Thaicom, but progress in penetrating key markets in China and India has been slow.
Thaicom was founded by former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. His relatives sold their controlling stake in Shin Corp PCL SHIN.BK, which owns 41 percent of Thaicom, to Singapore's Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL].
Thaicom shares erased earlier gain and were unchanged at 6.70 baht at the midday break, when the overall market was 0.95 percent higher. ($1=34.00 Baht) (Reporting by Pisit Changplagngam; Writing by Khettiya Jittapong; Editing by Alan Raybould)
