(Reuters) - Hoteliers in secondary cities are benefitting more from China's stimulus measures, with larger markets in Beijing and Shanghai weighed down by past construction booms, said Jones Lang LaSalle Hotels on Friday.
Tier-two and tier-three cities are benefiting from massive infrastructure spending, while the massive hotel expansion ahead of the 2008 Olympics saturated the Beijing market, said Andreas Flaig, Beijing-based managing director at the consultancy, a unit of Jones Lang LaSalle (
"Certainly for Beijing and Shanghai, one ought to be very cautious," he told Reuters, referring to investors and developers looking at the hotel market.
From 2006 to 2008, the number of hotel rooms doubled in Beijing and will grow another 23 percent through 2011, said Flaig. That buildout has pushed occupancy rates in Beijing to 47 percent for five-star hotels, and 50 percent in the four-star market.
"Once you drop below 50 percent occupancy, then you start to seriously impact the profitability of a hotel," said Flaig. "We are way off the 75-ish occupancy the city has enjoyed before."
But the economies in secondary cities such as Sanya, Dalian and Hangzhou are still growing around 15 percent, bouyed by domestic demand, central government stimulus measures and a lower reliance on export industries, he said.
"It is a reflection of the government stimulus and banks pumping in trillions of renminbi (yuan)," said Flaig. "Therefore, buying land to start new projects is easier now than six or nine months ago."
