(Reuters) - Japanese government bonds fell on Wednesday as Tokyo shares rallied after a sharp rebound in consumer confidence in the United States lifted hopes for the global economy.
The drop in JGBs followed a fall in U.S. government debt prices on Tuesday as U.S. consumer confidence soared in May to its highest level in eight months, pushing U.S. stocks higher. [ID:nN26489555]
But JGBs were underpinned by month-end buying by investors extending the durations of their bond holdings, analysts said.
"The market is reacting to stocks and the U.S. Treasury market, but the yield (for 10-year JGBs) remains rangebound between the lower and upper ends of 1.4 percent, and the market lacks strong incentives to break that range," said Naomi Hasegawa, a senior fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities.
June 10-year futures fell 0.32 point to 136.50 2JGBv1, a touch higher than the day's low of 136.49 which was their lowest in two weeks. Tokyo's Nikkei share average
The benchmark 10-year yield JP10YTN=JBTC rose 1.5 basis point to 1.455 percent, its highest in two weeks.
The two-year yield JP2YTN=JBTC was steady at 0.355 percent, while the 20-year yield JP20YTN=JBTC edged up 1 basis point to 2.115 percent.
The Bank of Japan's minutes from its April 30 policy meeting showed one board member said the BOJ needed to watch the impact on the JGB market of a big rise in issuance as the government plans to borrow heavily to fund economic stimulus steps. [ID:nTKZ006267]
Investors remained cautious about ongoing supply worries in the U.S. Treasuries market before auctions for five- and seven-year notes on Wednesday and Thursday respectively. Total issuance for this week is slated to be $101 billion, including Tuesday's 2-year auction. [US/]
Japan's exports showed modest signs of recovery in April with shipments to China declining at a slower pace than a year earlier, reinforcing market views that the worst of the global slump in trade may be over. A drop in exports to the U.S. was smaller than in March. [JPEXPY=ECI]
