CNOOC to run Huizhou plant at 70 pct capacity in May

(Reuters) - CNOOC's first major refinery in southern China will run at 70 percent capacity in May, in line with earlier forecasts, and the refiner is working to obtain permits to export fuel before any big boost in operations, an industry official said on Monday.
The 70 percent ratio at the 240,000 barrel-per-day Huizhou refinery, which was started in mid-March, compared with an average of more than 85 percent at major plants under refining giants Sinopec Corp (
) and PetroChina, signalling still slow Chinese fuel demand.
"Any big jump in operations will really depend on domestic consumption and also outlets in the international market," an official close to Huizhou's operations told Reuters.
The conservative operation rate, partly due to technical reasons to ensure safe runs at a newly started refinery, may extend through June, said the official.
CNOOC, new to China's refining business long controlled by Sinopec and PetroChina, has yet to obtain special export quotas for diesel and gasoline that are free from a 17 percent value added tax (VAT).
The policy, under which refiners import crude and export a set amount of refined products free from VAT, applies to Sinopec and PetroChina for the first half of 2009, a subsidy that helped boost China's overseas sales of diesel and gasoline and thin swollen domestic fuel stocks.
CNOOC may also team up with Chinaoil and Unipec, a trading vehicle of PetroChina and Sinopec, respectively, in its early days in the fuel export business, a Chinaoil official has said, after the firm joined hands with Singapore-based China Aviation Oil (
