"The overall trend in the consumer space continues to be reasonably positive," Navin Shenoy, Intel's general manager in the Asia-Pacific region, told Reuters on the sidelines of Computex, the world's second-biggest PC fair.
"If you look at consumer notebook sales now, they continue to be solid. The commercial market is a bit more challenging."
Intel on Monday launched a lighter, power-saving microprocessor intended for use in ultra-thin laptops, a move by the top chipmaker to shore up its lead in mobile computing. [nN0129506]
"In the next six months, I think (growth) momentum will be particularly strong in the ultra-thin laptop segment," said Shenoy, who is in charge of sales and marketing of Intel's products in the region, excluding Japan and China.
