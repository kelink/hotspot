(Reuters) - Japan's Mitsubishi Rayon Co 3404.T said on Monday it aims to complete its buyout of unlisted British chemicals maker Lucite International by the end of May, saying antitrust authorities worldwide had given the deal the go-ahead.
But the company has now obtained the necessary regulatory approvals, said Mitsubishi Rayon's spokesman Masahiro Okawara.
"We've won approvals from authorities of those countries that will or are likely to be affected by the merger," Okawara said, although he declined to say which countries. Lucite is the world's top maker of methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomers, used in the production of acrylic resins that are used in products ranging from liquid crystal displays and car lights to aquarium tanks.
Mitsubishi Rayon, Asia's top maker of MMA monomers, reached an agreement in November with Lucite's top shareholder Charterhouse Capital Partners to buy all shares of the British chemicals firm.
Shares of Mitsubishi Rayon fell 2.3 percent to 213 yen on Monday, against a 0.2 percent advance in the benchmark Nikkei average
