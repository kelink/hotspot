(Reuters) - South Africa's International Ferro Metals Ltd (
) said on Thursday it secured a three-year, 500 million rand ($64.14 million) banking facility from the Bank of China, sending its shares up as much as 12 percent.
The new working capital facility will allow the company to manage its liquidity and ensure a smooth restart of its second furnace, Numis Securities analyst Mike Stuart said in a note to clients.
"The company's decision at end-March to restart one furnace, while maintaining cash flow and monetising coke and chrome ore stockpiles, probably increased the loss due to poor received prices for its ferro-chrome through the period," analyst Stuart said.
He has a "buy" rating and a 61 pence price target on the company's stock.
Chief Financial Officer Dion Cohen stepped down and the company appointed Jannie Muller as CFO effective immediately, it said in a statement.
IFM said it planned to restart its second ferrochrome furnace in mid-August due to increased demand from Chinese steel industry, which is operating at near capacity.
IFM shares were up 12.1 percent at 44 pence at 0810 GMT on the London Stock Exchange. ($1=7.795 South African rand) (Reporting by Shivani Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)
