(Reuters) - Being the underdog suits Maria Sharapova at the French Open, where she enjoyed being backed by the fickle Parisian crowd in a 1-6 6-3 6-4 third round victory over Kazakh Yaroslava Shvedova on Friday.
But no longer the world number one, the 102nd ranked Russian seems to have become a firm favorite as she is on a comeback trail following a nine-month layoff with a career-threatening shoulder injury.
"Allez Maria!" the fans screamed as they cheered her on while she gasped for breath after running down many of her opponent's cunning drop shots.
Summing up the change of attitude toward her, Sharapova quipped: "You're ranked outside the top 100, so people like you."
"When you're number one in the world, for some reason they don't like you anymore. It's amazing how the society works.
"Especially here in France, I think they always love the underdog, and they always love the one that comes back from behind, or the one that's not expected to win. I'm probably that person," added the three-times grand slam champion, who will next face China's Li Na.
She pocketed the opening game on her opponent's serve but Shvedova broke straight back when the Russian sent a backhand wide.
She dropped serve again with her third double fault in the fourth game and then struggled to return Shvedova's heavy first serve.
The former world number one broke for 3-1 in the second set as the clock ticked past the hour. But she served a double fault at 40-30 in the following game and instead of going 4-1 up, Shvedova broke back.
"I could not serve at 100 percent because a muscle was pulling (in my arm) and because of this my arms got tired and it was difficult to hit the balls," said the Kazakh, who came to the post-match press conference with an ice pack wrapped around her arm.
