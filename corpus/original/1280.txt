Total's chief executive, Christophe de Margerie, said earlier this month the group did not intend to disengage from Nigeria altogether.
"It doesn't mean we are scared and intend to start some kind of walking out of Nigeria ... Total is happy to develop its projects in Nigeria," he told reporters at an energy conference in Abu Dhabi.

Other shareholders in the OML 138 oil block, located 100 kilometers off the coast of Nigeria, are Exxon (

Total's shares were up 2.5 percent by 1500 GMT, outperforming a 2.1 percent rise in the European oil and gas sector .SXEP
