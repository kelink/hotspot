(Reuters) - China's stocks were the best performer among major markets in the first quarter, rising 30 percent amid signs the world's third-largest economy may be the first to recover from the global downturn.
That was a marked contrast to 2008, when the benchmark Shanghai Composite Stock Index
plunged 65 percent and was the worst performer among the world's major stock markets.
Here are key events in the rise and fall of the Shanghai market, now the world's sixth-biggest by market capitalisation, since the start of the decade.
2000 - Shanghai is the world's best-performing major equity market, rising more than 50 percent on the back of reforms such as approvals for the creation of a large number of mutual funds.
April 2005 - The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announces proposals, including allowing companies to compensate the public for the sale of state-owned stock, under a reform programme to tackle the overhang of government share holdings.
May 30, 2007 - The Ministry of Finance announces an immediate rise in China's stock trading tax to 0.3 percent from 0.1 percent to cool the market, up more than 50 pct since start of year, as the government frets over an excessively rapid rise in share prices. The index falls 21 percent by June 5.
July 26 - The index reverses and resumes posting record highs, boosted by stronger-than-expected earnings estimates.
Oct. 16 - The index hits an intraday record high of 6,124.044, marking the peak of the bull market.
Jan 22, 2008 - The index falls 7.2 percent after Ping An Insurance (Group) (
April 24 - The index surges 9.3 percent as the government, anxious to halt the market's slide after a nearly 50 percent drop from its peak, cuts the stock trading tax back to 0.1 percent.
June 10 - The index falls 7.7 percent as the central bank raises banks' reserve requirements more than the market had expected. Monetary tightening becomes a key factor depressing the market, while the global financial crisis deepens.
Sept. 19 - The index soars 9.5 percent after an unprecedented package of government steps to support the market, including the purchase of stocks in major state-owned banks. The government has also shifted to monetary easing from tightening.
Oct. 28 - The index falls to 1,664.925, a 25-month low and the lowest point of the year's downtrend.
November - The government announces a 4 trillion yuan, two-year economic stimulus plan to curb the economy's slowdown.
2009 - The market begins to revive, rising 42 percent by midday on Friday amid signs that corporate earnings may recover and the economy may bottom out in the second quarter, as the stimulus plan bears fruit. ($1 = 6.83 Yuan) (Reporting by Lu Jianxin and Edmund Klamann; Editing by Neil Fullick)
