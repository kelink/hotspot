(Reuters) - External pressure for appreciation of the yuan is not so huge, Ma Delun, a vice-governor with the People's Bank of China, said at a banking event in Mumbai on Tuesday.
China has come under criticism from trade partners over the value of the yuan, including U.S. politicians who charge it is maintaining it at an undervalued rate to give its exporters an advantage.
China has kept the yuan flat against the dollar since mid-2008, prompting additional fund flows into emerging market currencies that do trade freely.
At a weekend meeting of the G20, British Finance Minister Alistair Darling told reporters the group "didn't discuss the renminbi. I think that's a question for China rather than us".
In Mumbai, Ma said China would take monetary steps depending on developments in the economy, and said external trade demand was weak.
"Trade in China has still not recovered to the levels seen last year, which means we still have weak external demand," he said.
India last month bought 200 tonnes of gold from the International Monetary Fund at an average price of $1,045 an ounce, half of the IMF's planned sale size of 403.3 tonnes.
"I haven't this kind of message from China," Ma said when asked in China planned to buy gold from the IMF. (Reporting by Swati Bhat and Suvashree Dey Choudhury; Editing by John Mair)
