(Reuters) - JCB is working hard to prevent posting its first annual loss due to a slump in demand for the UK construction equipment maker's products, its chief executive said in an interview with the Financial Times published on Wednesday.
JCB chief executive Matthew Taylor was quoted by the Financial Times as saying the company's revenues could drop by between 35 to 40 percent this year, which would make it one of the biggest year-on-year falls in the company's 64-year history.
"The company has never made an (annual) loss and we are going to work hard to try to prevent this happening," Taylor said in an interview held on Tuesday.
He said unit sales could drop to 35,000, compared with 56,000 in 2008.
"Looking around the world, with the exception of a few countries that include India, I can see few positive signs in relation to underlying demand," he said.
"In 2010 we are planning for demand (outside China) to be flat," he added.
Taylor said demand for machines in China this year would probably increase 10 to 15 percent, adding that a similar rate of growth was likely in 2010.
), the world's biggest maker of heavy machinery, said on Monday it plans to permanently cut 2,500 workers even as increasing demand will allow it to recall some employees who were laid off during the economic downturn. [ID:nN26186794]
