The Baltic Dry Freight Index .BADI, which can be a proxy for world trade patterns, rose 5.5 percent, pushed up by freight of iron ore to China.
"A 10th straight increase for the Baltic Dry and a 15-month high for AUD/USD (Australian/U.S. dollar) do not imply that sentiment is about to turn over," Kenneth Brough, an economist at Lloyds TSB, said in a research note.
