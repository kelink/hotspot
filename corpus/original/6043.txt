Fears aside, Taiwan to allow solo Chinese tourists

(Reuters) - Taiwan plans to let tourists from China travel on their own on the island, government officials said on Wednesday, a boost to the service sector as suspicions over spying and illegal immigration fade and relations improve.
Taiwan has admitted only tightly controlled tour groups since mid-2008. From as early as the end of the year it will allow individuals from China, just 160 km (100 miles) distant, wishing to travel on their own.
An influx of tourists will boost the service sector, from listed Taiwan hotels and airlines to small shops in the countryside where groups rarely venture.
"Individual travelers can go to every corner and spend money," said Anthony Liao, standing supervisor with the Taipei Association of Travel Agents.
"They don't necessarily have to stay in star-level hotels. They can take the high-speed rail or a bus instead of coaches. They can do the night markets and the small stores, not just souvenir shops. It's an advantage to the Taiwan economy."
The Taiwan stock exchange's tourism sub-index rose 2.36 percent on anticipation of individual travelers from China.
Permitting individual tourists, even if they still must obtain travel permits, marks a new high in fast-warming relations between Taiwan and China, which claims sovereignty over the self-ruled island.
The two sides set aside differences in 2008 to work out trade and transit deals including direct flights and an agreement that allows up to 3,600 Chinese group tourists per day.
Still, Taiwan is studying a daily headcount limit on individual travelers and may initially allow them only from China's wealthier cities, tourism and news officials said.
