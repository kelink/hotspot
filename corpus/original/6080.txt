Oil drops on weak China and U.S. economic data

(Reuters) - Oil fell more than 3 percent to below $73 a barrel on Thursday, its biggest one-day slide in nearly four weeks, as weak manufacturing data from China and the United States fueled concerns about economic growth.
China's manufacturing in June grew at the slowest pace in months on government actions to cool the property market and curb bank lending. In the United States, the Institute for Supply Management barometer of manufacturing activity fell much more than expected to 56.2.
U.S. crude for August delivery fell $2.68, or 3.54 percent, to settle at $72.95 a barrel, the lowest close since June 8 and its biggest one-day percentage loss since June 4.
Falling in tandem with base metals, gold and equity markets, oil prices declined for a fourth straight session. The drop extended the 9.7 percent slide of the second quarter, the first quarterly decline since 2008.
"I think oil is reflecting general negative commodity market sentiment after weaker-than-expected China PMI data overnight," said Carsten Fritsch, oil analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
Markets fell early, after China's official purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to a weaker-than-expected 52.1 in June, the lowest since February, from 53.9 in May.
The markets fell further after the U.S. government said initial jobless claims unexpectedly rose last week. Markets already were anxious about employment data ahead of the June nonfarm payrolls report on Friday. A Reuters survey has forecast a jobs loss of 110,000, the first decline of 2010.
The ISM report also disappointed markets, as did data showing pending sales of previously owned U.S. homes plunged a record 30 percent in May to an all-time low. The U.S. dollar index .DXY fell 1.58 percent and the S&P 500 stocks index
Crude stockpiles fell 2 million barrels, more than the expected decline of 900,000 barrels, and the government report showed Cushing, Oklahoma, crude stocks shed 795,000 barrels to 36 million barrels.
Energy provider Genscape said on Thursday that Cushing stocks fell 285,000 in the week to Tuesday.
The recent slip from record high storage at the Cushing hub has helped narrow the price spread between the front-month and near-month U.S. crude contracts, leaving it at 51 cents on Thursday, based on settlement prices.
After helping spark crude prices to above $79 on Monday, Hurricane Alex made landfall in Mexico on Thursday, sparing U.S. oil facilities near its path.
Companies on Thursday were already restarting some of the 421,350 barrels per day of oil output, about a quarter of Gulf of Mexico output, shut as a precaution.
