"The risks are higher now, with all the liquidity that has been pouring in from China and the U.S. there are worries an asset bubble is being created in Hong Kong. The 2,000 points gain on the main index in just a week is not healthy," said Patrick Shum, president at BMI Fund Management.

"The (CSCEC) IPO may lead the index to shed 100 to 200 points, but the uptrend remains unchanged," said Zhou Lin, an analyst at Huatai China Securities in Nanjing.
Analysts worried that it may be just a matter of time before the market, up more than 75 percent this year, moves into a short-term corrective phase, while many institutions will be allocating funds to subscribe to the CSCEC offering given its heavy weighting in the index and an expected strong debut despite the high IPO price.
