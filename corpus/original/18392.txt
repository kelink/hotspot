(Reuters) - Wilmar International (
), the world's largest palm oil firm, posted an 11 percent rise in its first-quarter net profit as higher processing and trading margins offset a decline in palm oil prices.
The company said it was looking at the possibility of listing its China operations in Hong Kong or Shanghai, but did not give more details.
"We remain cautiously optimistic on our group's prospects for the year," Kuok Khoon Hong, Chairman and CEO of Wilmar said in a statement.
Wilmar, which owns oil palm plantations and runs milling, crushing, refining and processing plants in Indonesia and Malaysia, earned $380 million in the January-March quarter, up from $343 million a year ago.
The company, which has a market capitalisation of $18 billion, is expected by analysts to book a net profit of $1.2 billion for the full year, according to Reuters Estimates. That compares with $1.5 billion made in 2008.
Wilmar's first-quarter revenue fell by 31 percent to $4.96 billion, as palm oil prices dropped due to falling demand as a result of global economic slowdown.
Malaysia's benchmark palm oil price dropped from a record high of 4,486 ringgit ($1,278) per tonne in early March 2008 to 2,000 ringgit at the end of the first quarter this year.
However, prices have recovered and are now trading at around 2,700 ringgit a tonne.
Its shares have risen 49 percent so far this year, compared with a 24 percent rise in Singapore's main stock index
