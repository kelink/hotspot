Speaking at a meeting for analysts, Jim Owens, Caterpillar's chairman and chief executive, also reiterated the company's sales and revenue forecast for the current year and said that in future recessions Caterpillar would be able to report annual earnings of $2.50 a share.
That's well above the 40 cents a share to $1.50 a share the company expects to report this year after suffering its worst one-year drop in sales since the Great Depression and laying off tens of thousands of workers. Factoring out the cost of layoffs, it expects to earn $1.15 to $2.25.
The upbeat presentation by Owens and other members of Caterpillar management sent the company's shares higher on the New York Stock Exchange, even though some analysts at the event called the 2012 goals -- the company does not consider them hard targets just yet -- as "a stretch" given continued weakness in key end markets like construction and the enormous investment Caterpillar needs to make to expand its presence in emerging markets.
In subsequent presentations by other top executives, Caterpillar laid out ambitious targets for revenue growth in emerging markets, especially China, where the company expects 2012 sales well above $4 billion by growing its six current plants to 16.
The meeting comes just weeks after Caterpillar reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings and raised its full-year forecast, thanks, in part, to strong margins in its engine unit, which makes everything from turbines used by oil and gas companies to reciprocating diesel engines used in its own machines.
Owens said Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment, wanted to maintain its dividend through the current down cycle and predicted that some competitors would be forced out of business if industry sales remained at current levels.
In afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading, Caterpillar was up $2.54 or 5.6 percent at $47.66.
