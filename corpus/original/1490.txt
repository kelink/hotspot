Sales of Japanese cars in China have dropped since protests erupted across the country in mid-September over the Japanese government's purchase of a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea.
Toyota's China sales fell 40 percent in September from a year earlier, and sales at Mazda Motor Corp (

For the first nine months of 2012, GM's sales in China were up 10 percent to 2.08 million vehicles.
