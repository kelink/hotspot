(Reuters) - EU regulators are set to accept commitments offered by IACS, a trade group for ship inspection companies, to settle an antitrust case as early as next Wednesday, a person familiar with the situation said.
The European Commission had in June asked rival ship classification societies for comment on proposals by IACS to adopt non-discriminatory membership criteria and to open the trade body's technical working groups to competitors.
"A commitment decision could come next Wednesday in which the Commission closes the case based on the commitments offered by IACS," the person told Reuters on Friday.
"There are not expected to be any major changes to the commitments," the person said.
A commitment decision essentially means companies charged by the Commission, the European Union's executive arm, do not admit any illegal behaviour and pay no fine.
But the EU executive could levy a penalty of up to 10 percent of a company's global turnover if the firm fails to comply with the legally binding commitments.
IACS, the International Association of Classification Societies, proposed the commitments after the Commission raided several ship classifiers in January 2008 on suspicion they had violated EU rules on restrictive business practices.
The Commission did not identify the societies. IACS members include British-based Lloyd's Register, the American Bureau of Shipping, the China Classification Society, Norway's Det Norske Veritas, Germanischer Lloyd, the Korean Register of Shipping, the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping and Japan's Nippon Kaiji Kyokai.
