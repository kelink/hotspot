(Reuters) - Grupo Modelo, maker of the popular Corona beer, sees sales in Mexico declining less than the economy's expected contraction of 4.1 percent as it prepares to launch a new plant to serve U.S. and Canadian markets.
"Beer consumption has always been tied to gross domestic product growth," Chief Executive Carlos Fernandez told the Reuters Latin American Investment Summit in a phone interview on Monday. "We think (sales) decline won't be as sharp as the GDP's."
Fernandez, responsible for taking Mexican beers to far-away markets like Australia and China, said the country is much better prepared now than years ago to face a financial crisis but acknowledged Mexico is not immune to the U.S. slowdown.
Mexico ships around 80 percent of its exports, from autos to electronics, to the United States.
"The plant is focused on exports, mostly to supply the United States and Canada," Fernandez said.
Fernandez said Modelo's legal challenge against U.S. partner Anheuser-Busch, which started last October, is continuing.
The Mexican brewer claims Anheuser-Busch, which owned half of Grupo Modelo, did not consult it about Belgian brewer InBev's takeover of Anheuser-Busch last year.
),the world's largest brewer.
"We believe there are merits to the claim," Fernandez said.
Despite the spat, both companies continue to work as usual, distributing each other brands in Mexico, the United States and other markets.
