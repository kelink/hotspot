(Reuters) - China's new loans in the second half of the year will not exceed the peak in the first half, a top executive from China Construction Bank (CCB) (
"It's very unlikely new lending will be at the same level as in H1," Fan Yifei, CCB deputy president, told Reuters on the sidelines of an event marking the launch of China UnionPay cards in Taiwan.
China's 7.72 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion) of new loans in the first half have generally gone to areas supported by the government's macroeconomic policies while lending risks are under control, the country's banking regulator said on Monday. [ID:nSHA349875]
But investor concern about tighter liquidity still lingered, sending Chinese stocks down 0.34 percent on Monday to their lowest close in three weeks following last week's slumps. [ID:nBJD001041]
Separately, China Unionpay, controlled by the Chinese central bank, said it would issue credit cards in Taiwan, a further sign of warming trade ties across the Taiwan Straits.
"We see demand for issuing cards, but it takes negotiations for that to happen," said president Xu Luo De of China Unionpay.
No timetable had been set, Xu said.
About 600,000 Chinese tourists are expected to visit Taiwan each year, generating consumption of about T$35 billion ($1.1 billion), a third of which would be new spending on China Unionpay cards, according to Taiwan government officials.
