) are raising prices to pass soaring raw material costs on to customers, but their attempts may not pass muster with bargain-hungry shoppers.
Many analysts questioned the timing of the move, especially since consumers in the developed world continue to look for incentives to buy expensive goods like appliances.
"They can call out price increases, which is what I expected to hear from them given the increase in (prices of) steel, but whether those price increases stick is another thing altogether," Wall Street Strategies analyst Brian Sozzi said, citing failed attempts by Whirlpool to raise prices early last year.
Some also worried that the price increases would erode Whirlpool's market share, especially since some Korean rivals are sticking with existing price tags.
) have not announced increases and appear to be planning to hold existing prices, Longbow Research analyst David MacGregor said in an earlier note.
Still, Whirlpool's chief executive, Jeff Fettig, insisted it was not "economically feasible" for Whirlpool to remain indefinitely in the promotional mindset it adopted for the holiday season and last year in general.
Whirlpool sees raw materials costs for this year rising $250 million to $300 million. Its shares were down 2.3 percent at $83.46 at midday, off an earlier low at $79.76.
"For 2011, we expect positive but uneven demand levels around the world," Fettig said, adding the company still hoped to expand operating margins in the year through price increases and boosts in productivity.
Whirlpool has shut plants, cut jobs and moved some manufacturing to lower cost centers like Mexico. It has also started using common parts across its lineup of dishwashers, refrigerators and washing machines.
Net earnings at the maker of Maytag and KitchenAid appliances rose to $171 million, or $2.19 a share, in the fourth quarter, from $95 million or $1.24 a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned $2.11 a share, missing the analysts' average estimate of $2.26 a share.
Sales rose 4 percent to $5.0 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $4.8 billion.
For the year, Whirlpool expects to earn $12 to $13 a share.
Sweden's Electrolux also missed earnings forecasts and further disappointed investors by not returning money to shareholders via a hoped-for special dividend. The cash-rich company instead extended its share buyback program. Its shares sank 7.8 percent.
"It is a bit disappointing there is no extra dividend," said DnB NOR analyst Ole-Andreas Krohn.
Adding more pain, Electrolux said it put plans to buy Egypt-based appliance maker Olympic Group OLGR.CA on hold due to unrest there.
Electrolux, which sells under its own name as well as the Zanussi and Frigidaire brands, is planning to raise prices by 8 percent to 10 percent in North America starting in April and gradually in Europe and other markets.
Electrolux Chief Executive Keith McLoughlin said the rise in raw materials' costs had been across the board.
"In the first quarter we are going to have raw materials hitting us immediately," he told Reuters in an interview after reporting core earnings of 1.71 billion crowns ($257.8 million).
The company raised its forecast for the impact of raw material costs to a range of 1.5 billion to 2 billion crowns, higher than the previous 1.5 billion crown forecast.
The uneven demand forecast from Whirlpool echoed Electrolux's earlier comments.
McLoughlin said that overall markets were growing, but again most of the growth was coming in emerging markets like Eastern Europe, China and India.
"There is a global economic recovery happening," he told Reuters. Market growth was in the low single digits in mature markets but up to 7 percent to 9 percent in places like China and India.
