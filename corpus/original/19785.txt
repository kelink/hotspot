Asia's largest maker of aluminium extrusion products kicked off marketing on Monday for a sale of 1.4 billion shares, or nearly 26 percent of its enlarged share capital, at HK$6.80-HK$8.80 each ahead of a May 8 trading debut.

The price range values Zhongwang at 10.4 to 13.5 times forecast 2009 profits, and at the high end would make the company worth about $6.1 billion.

Company officials and the firm's bankers this week marketed the deal in Asia before heading to Europe and the United States for meetings with institutional investors there.
