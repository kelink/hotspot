China may take action on stocks if slide worsens

(Reuters) - China's stock market has slid 26 percent this year, making it one of the world's worst performing markets and raising questions whether authorities may take action to prevent the market from tumbling much more sharply.
A crackdown on the country's red-hot real estate sector combined with a money market squeeze due to a flood of share issuances -- including Agricultural Bank of China's ABC.UL record $22 billion offer -- have driven the Shanghai Composite Index
The government, already facing rising worker unrest, high property prices and inflation concerns, will likely want to avoid drawing the ire of Chinese investors watching their savings dwindle in the country's volatile market. But so far the market drop is not severe enough to prompt action.
Below are some scenarios on how officials may intervene against a further market drop. Chinese officials have historically taken measures in the stock market, both to limit big surges and slides.
Unless the index falls below 2,200 points from the 2,413 level at midday on Thursday, Chinese authorities are unlikely to do anything to stop the market from falling, analysts said.
Officials may also be happy to have taken the steam out of the stock market in the past year by unleashing IPOs and cracking down on the money going into the stock market, especially from bank lending. In the first half of 2009, the Shanghai market soared more than 60 percent.
After the property market restrictions prompted household investors -- the biggest force in the market -- to shed shares, tight money market conditions have only made things worse.
The benchmark money market rates have soared as banks have had trouble raising funds due to the squeeze, limiting the ability of investors to borrow and forcing them to dump shares to raise cash.
Now that AgBank's blockbuster issue is just over, some of the money that failed to win in the subscription process is expected to go back into stocks. AgBank has also given confidence to the other major state-owned banks about raising funds now.
) are both reported to be preparing rights issues, but the news has made few waves in the shares -- suggesting investors have expected these funding needs.
A drop in the Shanghai Composite below the 15-month low of 2,319 hit this week and toward 2,200 points may prompt authorities to consider taking modest steps to boost the market.
Chinese firms siphoned off around 450 billion yuan ($66 billion) from the stock market via initial public offerings, rights issues and new share issues in the first half of the year.
About 60 to 70 firms are now on a waiting list to issue shares, with the total amount of money to be drained from the market by corporate fundraising via stocks expected to reach 800 billion yuan this year, analysts estimate.
"If the market starts to get out of control the authorities will start to examine the situation," said an equity analyst at a Chinese brokerage in Shanghai.
Another option is the People's Bank of China injecting more liquidity into the money markets via its open market operations.
The Chinese central bank has injected a hefty nearly 900 billion yuan ($133 billion) into money markets over the past seven weeks to help ease the cash crunch, caused mainly by the AgBank IPO and indirectly hitting shares.
Raising the stamp duty for stock sellers is another method, but analysts say this would be largely symbolic and not result in swift gains for stocks.
Analysts say authorities are unlikely to take more severe measures like suspending IPOs or directly buying up stakes in large state-owned banks and companies. They may instead use state funds, such as Central Huijin, to purchase shares indirectly.
At the same time, analysts say the government does not wish to project the impression that it is directly intervening in market activities.
Beijing is pushing on many different fronts to modernize the country's markets and has even backed away from direct day-to-day intervention on the yuan after ditching the currency's peg to the dollar last month.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
They have stock index futures,and can happily short the index.Don¡¯t worry.

THIS ARTICLE IS REALLY INCREDIBLE!! The author acknowledges that the Chinese stock market is msnipulated by the Government, when it deams convenient to do so. This is not shocking, as anybody knows that this is a fact. the shocking part is that he writes as it this is a normal occurence !! What is also a fact that Wall Street, under pressure of the large US corporations which use the hunger salaries in China to manufacture there, CLOSES THE EYES not only to this manipulation, but to the invented statistics and information coming from the Chinese Government. One of the above is that the China is running a gigantic internal deficit, as they compute as an active literally millions of loans to state enterprises which are factually bankrupt and equally important, to ¡°friendly¡± enterprises and individuals, which never will or can be repaid. The latter is the way used by many of the Chinese billionaires to become such!
