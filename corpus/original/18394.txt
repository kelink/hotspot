UPDATE 2-Mapfre sees no chance of China partner short term

(Reuters) - Spanish insurer Mapfre (
) said on Tuesday it saw no possibility of finding a partner in China at least in the short term, mainly due to the country's complicated insurance sector regulation.
In February, Mapfre said it was eyeing expansion in China but was looking for a partner as foreign companies are not allowed to own more than 20 percent of local insurance companies.
"We have had a representational office in China for years, with the clear aim of developing our business there. But the regulation is complicated...It's not an easy task and in the short term we do not see a possibility of any partner," Mapfre Managing Director Esteban Tejera told journalists.
Mapfre's premium income rose 11.1 percent to 4.5 billion euros ($6.13 billion) in the first quarter, with strong growth abroad compensating for weakness in its domestic market.
Its U.S. insurance group, Commerce, which was consolidated for the first time in the quarter, helped boost the international division's premium income to 476.7 million euros -- or 44 percent of the total -- from 135.4 million a year ago, Mapfre said in a statement.
The increased debt incurred with the Commerce buy was "of quite a concern...but now we have no liquidity problems," Tejera said.
Income from premiums in Spain fell 5.7 percent, hit by delays in the planned launch of a life insurance campaign through savings bank Caja Madrid's branches.
Mapfre's shares closed up 0.84 percent at 2.40 euros.
