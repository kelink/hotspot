North Korea's Kim enjoys war-themed sing-song

(Reuters) - South Korean media have speculated on the whereabouts of reclusive North Korean leader Kim Jong-il since a trip to China last month, with some newspapers suggesting he may have taken to an underground bunker amid threats of war.
South Korea has blamed the North for torpedoing a naval vessel in March killing 46 South Korean sailors, fuelling bellicose rhetoric on both sides of the world's most heavily militarized border.
But North Korea's sometimes shrill KCNA news agency shed a little light on Kim's recent activities for the first time in a long time, saying he enjoyed an "art performance" given by the Korean People's Army. War appeared to be the prominent theme.
The show included "agitation through reminiscences" called "Comrades! Take This Revolver, Please!," wartime songs "My Song in the Trench," "To a Decisive Battle" and "For My Only Motherland" and a chorus of "The Road of Victory."
KCNA is famous for its gushing praise of "Dear Leader" Kim and raucous accusations of war-mongering by the United States and its "puppet," South Korea.
"Noting that the servicepersons of the KPA have grown to be indomitable fighters who cherish the spirit of devotedly defending the leader and the spirit of becoming human bombs as their unshakable faith, he (Kim) stressed that socialism centered on the popular masses in the DPRK (North Korea) is invincible and the revolutionary cause of Juche (self-reliance) is sure to emerge victorious as the defense line of the country is reliably defended by that matchless great army."
