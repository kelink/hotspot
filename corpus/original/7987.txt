(Reuters) - Irish building group CRH (
), the United States' leading asphalt producer, said poor weather and cost cuts would more than halve full-year profit, bringing its first forecast of the year below analysts' projections.
CRH said it would make a larger than anticipated dent in its three-year 1.45 billion euros ($2.17 billion) cost cutting plan in 2009, to leave profit before tax of between 730-760 million euros, sending its shares down more than 3 percent.
An average forecast of 14 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S was for pretax profit before exceptional items for the year to Dec. 31 of 899.31 million euros, down from 1.63 billion euros in 2008.
"The market is a little bit disappointed, there were one or two little surprises that were slightly negative rather than slightly positive," one Dublin-based trader said.
"The numbers are a little bit shy for the current year but a lot of the (cost cutting) actions which were talked about will kick in next year and there's a lot more confidence about the 2010 numbers," the trader added.
In July, the company announced a target of 555 million euros in annualised cost savings for 2009 and 2010, on top of 895 million announced in January.
The group said on Tuesday it will make 200 million euros of those savings this year, 42 million euros more than previously expected.
Shares in the Dublin-based group, which represents around one-third of the Irish stock exchange, were down 3.2 percent at 17.33 euros by 1130 GMT.
CRH, which is also the No.3 producer in the U.S of aggregates -- a category of building materials -- said increased demand from projects funded by the U.S. government's $787 billion stimulus programme had partly offset lower private sector demand in its Americas materials division.
), the No.1 and No.2 producers of aggregates in the U.S., reported last week that stimulus projects were proving slow to rollout, CRH said it expected it to provide additional work next year, without giving specific guidance.
The Dublin-based group, which said trading conditions on the ground remain extremely difficult, said third-quarter sales showed modest improvement, falling 19 percent compared with the 21 percent drop recorded in the typically weaker first half.
CRH said it continued to generate strong cash flow, reducing net debt by 0.9 billion euros in the third quarter to 4.2 billion, a figure its finance director said would fall below 4 billion by the end of 2009 if it made no further acquisitions.
The group has dipped slightly into its 1.24 billion euros war chest, boosted by a rights issue in March, by spending 50 million euros on bolt-on acquisitions in its American Materials division and in China in the third quarter.
"This could bring the total cost programme to close to 1.8 billion, substantially more than any of CRH's peers in either absolute terms or as a percent of the existing base," Barry Dixon, analyst at Davy, said in a note.
"Ultimately, this will be a big positive when markets recover." ($1=.6676 Euro) (Editing by Andras Gergely and Jon Loades-Carter)
