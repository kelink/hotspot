"Currency, along with a host of other issues, will come up, and I'm confident that both the United States and China can arrive at a broad set of policies that encourages trade that benefits both countries, that allows ongoing economic growth," Obama told Reuters in an interview.
U.S. manufactures complain that Beijing artificially holds the value of the yuan down to make its exports cheaper, and American goods more expensive for Chinese consumers.
Obama has so far resisted domestic pressure to brand China as a currency manipulator, which could anger a crucial U.S. creditor. Instead, Obama said that the two countries share a common interest in delivering sustainable growth that will help rebalance the global economy.
"They have a huge amount of U.S. dollars that they are holding, so our success is important to them. The flip-side of that is that if we don't solve some of these problems, then I think both economically and politically it will put enormous strains on the relationship," he said.
"Our manufacturers, I think, would have legitimate concerns about our ability to sell into China," he said, and emphasized that boosting U.S. sales oversees was a crucial part of his economic agenda.
