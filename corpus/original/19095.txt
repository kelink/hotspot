Chavez, a strident U.S. critic, has reduced the frequency of tirades against what he calls the "empire" since Obama took office as U.S. president in January, but he returned to the theme in a speech at a workers' march on Friday.
"He says he is here to make changes ... this is not about speeches or smiles, it's about realities," said Chavez, who shook hands warmly with Obama at a meeting of leaders from the Americas.
Chavez, who expelled the U.S. ambassador to Venezuela last year, approached Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the summit to discuss restoring normal ties between the two countries. Chavez has proposed sending a new ambassador to Washington.
"If President Obama does not dismantle this savage blockade of the Cuban people, then it is all a lie, it will all be a great farce and the U.S. empire will be alive and well, threatening us," Chavez said.
Obama has already loosened travel restrictions to Cuba, a close ally of Venezuela.
Clinton said she was worried that Bush administration policies of isolating leaders from those countries and supporting opposition groups had allowed China, Russia and Iran to make inroads into the region.
