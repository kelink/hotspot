China vows lending control to tame inflation

(Reuters) - China's central bank took aim at inflation once again on Monday by saying it will control lending and money growth in the world's second-biggest economy to head off price pressures and asset bubbles.
In a statement on the central bank's website (www.pbc.gov.cn), Hu Xiaolian, a deputy governor, said China had been normalizing policy and will explore new ways to manage excess cash, which is seen as a major driver behind 28-month high inflation.
Her remarks reinforced statements from China's top leaders that the task of taming inflation will be a priority for Beijing next year.
"An implementation of prudent monetary policy is helpful in strengthening the management of inflationary expectations and in fending off asset bubbles," Hu said.
On Saturday -- Christmas Day -- the central bank surprised investors with a 25-basis-point rate rise in benchmark deposit and lending rates, its second increase in just over two months.
Hu reiterated the central bank's determination to drain excess cash from the financial system by using all tools at its disposal: interest rates, reserve requirement ratios, open market operations and more.
"We will explore new tools ... to keep a good control on the gate of liquidity," she said, but did not indicate what these might be.
A Reuters poll showed investors see the benchmark one-year deposit rate rising to 3.25 percent by the end of next year, from 2.75 percent now.
The specter of more tightening cast a pall over Chinese stocks on Monday, though investors abroad were more sanguine, in part due to confidence that China's steady tightening is a sign of solid growth in its vast economy.
In a separate statement, the monetary policy committee within the central bank noted China's economic resilience, but with a touch of caution.
"The improving trend in our economy is solidifying and the financial system is working smoothly," the committee said after a quarterly meeting.
"But it is still a pressing task to manage credit, money and liquidity as well as cut financial risks," it said.

What free market are you talking about? The one where gov¡¯t spending is 45% of total economic activity? And where there¡¯s a >14 trillion dollar federal deficit? And direct subsidization (euphemistically called ¡®bailouts¡¯) totaling over 2 trillion dollars our companies deemed too large to fail hence making all other subsidies in the history of the world looking pale in comparison? Surely you aren¡¯t referring to the US economy and market because doing so would be beyond hypocritical. It¡¯s insane that our officials can even hold there head up, even more ridiculous if they preach about free trade and small government, after what we¡¯ve done. http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/downchart_gs.php?year=1900_2010&units=p&title=Spending%20as%20percent%20of%20GDP

With the Fed continuing it¡¯s inflationary monetary policies in the U.S. and China pursuing policies to cut inflation the Dollar can only decline against the Chinese currency.That should set us up for some real inflation problems in 2011.I can¡¯t believe so much of the public is concerned about unemployment and not inflation.
