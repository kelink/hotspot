In the first seven months of the year, Audi sales fell 8.1 percent to 551,000 units -- a decline mitigated by a 15 percent gain in China.
As a result, the share of volumes sold in China as a percentage of the overall group has risen to 14.6 percent in January through July versus 11.9 percent for the full year 2008.

In the first half, Mercedes-Benz brand sales fell 19 percent to 483,300 vehicles while BMW brand volumes also dropped 19 percent to 513,591 units.
