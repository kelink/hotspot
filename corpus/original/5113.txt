China relaxes rules for currency forwards

(Reuters) - China will allow more banks to sell currency forwards to their clients to further develop demand and the nation's nascent derivatives market, the country's foreign exchange regulator said on Tuesday.
Smaller Chinese banks that were previously barred from selling currency forwards can now partner their bigger, approved counterparts to offer forward contracts to clients, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange said on its website.
To match its growing economic clout, China wants to deepen its financial market by gently easing the government's tight grip over the currency and interest rate regimes.
Currently, a Chinese bank must have an annual foreign exchange turnover of at least $20 billion before it can apply for a license to sell currency forwards.
Bank of China is the biggest player in the forwards market and sells forwards for a range of currencies including the U.S. dollar, the euro, sterling, the Hong Kong dollar and the yen.
While the yuan is still firmly controlled by China's government, the break of its de facto peg to the U.S. dollar in June has made it slightly more volatile.
In the long run, this should feed demand for currency forwards among Chinese importers and exporters, most of whom are not still not used to exchange rate fluctuations and are inexperienced in managing currency risks.
China's control over the yuan has often drawn flak from U.S. politicians, who accuse the world's second-largest economy of manipulating its currency to gain trade advantage.
