TREASURIES-Prices slide as investors choose equities

(Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries prices slid on Wednesday after a rally in global equities and positive comments on China's economy hurt demand for safe-haven U.S. government debt.
Russia's statement that it would reduce the share of U.S. Treasuries in its reserves also weighed.
A Russian senior central bank official said Russia would reduce the share of U.S. Treasuries in its foreign exchange reserves, the world's third-largest. The news drove the dollar lower. Russia holds about 30 percent of the reserves, worth $404.2 billion, in Treasuries.
"The catalyst (for the bond market's decline) overnight were the statements out of China that property sales and investment are accelerating, said Andrew Brenner, senior vice president at MF Global in New York. "The word 'accelerating' has gotten people's attention."
Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR were down 12/32 in price, their yields rising to 3.92 percent from 3.87 percent on Tuesday.
As the morning progresses, traders will position themselves for the Treasury's $19 billion 10-year note auction, a reopening with a 3-1/8 percent coupon.
"For today expect modest support at the recent high yield at 3.92 percent," said John Spinello, chief fixed-income technical strategist at Jefferies & Co in New York.
Selling could emerge if 10-year yields ease to 3.85 percent to 3.815 percent; and if demand for the auction proves extremely weak, the 10-year yield could rise as high as 4.03 percent, he said.
The main economic release for the rest of the session will be the Federal Reserve's Beige Book, an anecdotal account of business conditions across the nation.
Two-year notes US2YT=RR, hit in recent days by fears the Fed could raise interest rates next year, were unchanged, yielding 1.32 percent.
Thirty-year bonds US30YT=RR were down 30/32, their yields rising to 4.72 percent from 4.66 percent on Tuesday. (Editing by Andrea Ricci)
