(Reuters) - World stocks put in solid gains on Monday as investors bet on a positive outcome to the euro zone crisis talks and took comfort from signs that China's economy may not be in as much danger as feared.
Some progress was made in Brussels over the weekend, with agreements near on bank recapitalization and on how to leverage the European Union's EFSF rescue fund to try to stop bond market contagion.
"We're still waiting for the comprehensive crisis plan and divisions remain, but it looks like we're getting close to the deal on EFSF leveraging and bank recapitalization," said a senior trader at a major Japanese bank.
Perhaps equally of importance to investor sentiment was a rise in China's flash purchasing managers' index, suggesting that manufacturing in the world's second-largest economy expanded moderately in October after three months of contraction.
This will have eased fears that China's economy is heading for a hard landing, one of the major concerns for global investors along with the euro zone crisis and the slowdown in the United States.

"People are getting increasingly nervous that (the next EU summit) won't deliver," a trader said.
