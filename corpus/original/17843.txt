US Senate denies money for closing Cuba prison

(Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Wednesday denied President Barack Obama the $80 million he sought to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay and senators will soon decide whether to also drop his request for more aid for the International Monetary Fund.
Bucking Obama, his fellow Democrats who control the Senate decided to dump the money after intense Republican criticism. That could make it potentially more difficult for the president to fulfill his promise to close the prison on the U.S. naval base in Cuba by January 2010.
Senators also face another controversial request by Obama: to provide up to $108 billion for the IMF to help countries through the global financial crisis as well as authorize the U.S. representative to the IMF to support the institution's planned gold sale.
Republican Senator Jim DeMint plans to offer an amendment to drop the IMF provisions, including the funding and support for the IMF's plan to sell 400 tons of gold to raise more money for operations.
Obama, during the Group of 20 meeting last month, pledged $100 billion for a special IMF lending program for those suffering from the global downturn. He also asked Congress for about $8 billion to increase the U.S. contribution to the IMF.
"There is a bailout fatigue in our country and concern about spending," DeMint told Reuters. "When people realize we're borrowing another $100 billion probably from China in order to give it to an international fund so they can give it to other countries, I think people are going to be outraged."
DeMint said he did not know if he could win the vote. Because the IMF aid is essentially extending credit lines, congressional budget advisers have said lawmakers only needed to appropriate $5 billion in the legislation. (Editing by Eric Beech)
