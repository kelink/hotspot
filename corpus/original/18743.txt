(Reuters) - Spanish water utility Aguas de Barcelona (Agbar) AGS.MC expects its water division will double its 2008 revenue level within three years thanks to greater demand for both its traditional and consulting businesses, the firm's managing director said on Wednesday.
The company also expects to maintain its 20 percent EBITDA margin on sales through to 2011 and sees opportunities in Latin America from 2010, Angel Simon told the Reuters Latin American Summit in a telephone interview.
"Up until next year, the Latin American authorities in general aren't carrying out any significant investments," Simon said, adding: "That doesn't mean we won't be ready for when they crop up, as of 2010."
The company, controlled by Barcelona-based holding company Criteria CRIT.MC and French utility Suez (
), expects to shortly close contracts for about 25 million euros each for consultancy work in Brazil, Peru and the Dominican Republic, he said.
The company also has operations in Algeria, China and Britain, and aims at maintaining a balance in its mix of foreign currency revenues.
Consultancy provided about 375 million euros of Agbar's Latin American revenues in 2008, and another 325 million euros came from water supply and treatment in the region. The company hopes to boost the latter category's revenues to 700 million euros by 2011.
A third of Agbar's 450 million euro investment budget this year will go to Latin America, mostly to Chile, where it operates Aguas Andinas. The company also hopes to boost its presence in Cuba, Mexico and Colombia.
Agbar expects its global water division, responsable for almost 80 percent of operating results in 2008, should boost revenues to 4 billion euros by 2011, up from 2 billion last year.
Of that total, 2.6 billion should come from regulated water contracts and the remainder from consultancy, Simon said.
The company sees its home market Spain as a mature market, although detects opportunities in environmental services. It has dropped the idea of buying the water division of construction company Sacyr Vallehermoso (
), after disagreeing over the price, he said.
At 1516 GMT, Agbar shares were trading down 3.16 percent at 15.30 euros, compared to a 1.05-percent rise in Spain's leading-share Ibex index
