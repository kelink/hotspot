(Reuters) - Chinese industrial profits in a wide sample of provinces fell 9.1 percent in the first nine months from a year earlier, a slower pace of decline than a month earlier, the statistics agency said on Wednesday.

The statistics agency said in a statement on its website that in the first three quarters, profits rose or experienced a slower pace of decline in 35 of the 39 industries it surveyed, including the rubber and building material sectors, which saw profits rise 53.9 percent and 21.8 percent, respectively.
Sectors that reported continuing big losses were oil exploration, steel and nonferrous metals, it said.
The figures cover only companies above a certain size, and exclude many smaller companies that have been hit hardest by the economic slowdown. However, the figures offer a rough guide to profitability trends.
The 22 Chinese provinces represent 78.6 percent of industrial profits in China, including all provinces and regions apart from Beijing, Inner Mongolia, Hunan, Guangdong, Anhui, Hainan, Chongqing, Yunnan and Tibet.
In its more extensive nationwide survey, which is published four times a year, the NBS said industrial profits fell 10.6 percent in the first eight months of 2009 compared with the same period a year earlier. (Reporting by Aileen Wang and Jason Subler; Editing by Jonathan Hopfner)
