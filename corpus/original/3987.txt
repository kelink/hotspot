(Reuters) - Global private equity firm Carlyle Group CYL.UL has raised 3.2 billion yuan ($495 million) for its projected 5 billion yuan China fund, launched last year, the firm said in a statement.

Investors in private equity funds typically commit an agreed amount to a fund for up to 10 years, and the money can be called for investment at any time during the investment period.
While banks and insurers are able to invest in private equity funds in China, getting official approval for these investments is also time-consuming, which adds to the difficulty for foreign firms to raise yuan funds, said the source, who was not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be identified.
