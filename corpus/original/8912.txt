(Reuters) - Bank of China (
), the country's biggest foreign exchange lender, posted a 19 percent rise in third-quarter profit, boosted by a lending boom as a huge government stimulus measures helped China lift the global economy out of recession.
China's banks extended a record 8.67 trillion yuan ($1,270 billion) in new loans in January-September, well ahead of this year's minimum target for 5 trillion yuan, as the government adopted ultra-loose monetary policies to stimulate the world's No.3 economy.
But bank margins have felt the squeeze after a string of rate cuts late last year, and lenders face tighter capital rules as regulators rein in loan growth that has helped jolt the economy back into robust growth of nearly 9 percent.
Beijing-based BOC reported July-September earnings of 21.11 billion yuan ($3.1 billion), compared with 17.8 billion yuan a year earlier. The result is in line with expectations of seven analysts polled by Reuters, who had forecast a third-quarter profit of 20.32 billion yuan.

China's new loans may fall next year to 7 trillion yuan from an expected 10 trillion yuan in 2009, but bank interest margins have bottomed and will improve as the economy recovers, according to Citic Securities.
Bank of China's net interest margin was 2.03 percent during the first nine months, 0.65 percentage point lower than the same period of last year.
