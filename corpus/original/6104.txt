(Reuters) - Leaders of the Group of Eight industrialized countries and the wider Group of 20, which includes big emerging economies such as China and Brazil, are meeting in Canada on Saturday.
On China's move to loosen the peg between its yuan currency and the dollar: "This is an important step toward helping China better meet its own challenges and providing a more level playing field for all its trading partners."
-- On the need for the G20 to go for growth: "We all recognize that as part of an effective strategy to make sure that we're bringing this world out of crisis, we have to make sure that people understand that we are going to take the steps necessary to bring down our deficits over time. But we also need to make sure we're growing. We have to find the right balance. That balance is going to differ across countries. But I think you're going to see a strong commitment again by these major economies to do what is necessary to make sure that we are supporting recovery and getting that balance right." "
On the possibility of new, global taxes on banks and financial transactions: "We have to have a framework to impose a tax on banks and we will launch it. We will not impose a bank tax on others, but we want a framework .... and we will fight to get it."
"We are not at the end of the road for financial market regulations, but in the middle."
"We believe that standards and supervision are two sides of the same coin of strong, sound financial systems,"
"While we need to continue our cooperation at the G20, it will always be a case that countries will need to tailor global agreements to suit domestic circumstances,"
-- On fiscal measures: "Concerns over fiscal sustainability in some European countries ... underscore the need for advanced deficit economies across the world to establish credible fiscal plans." However, Swan believes that the speed and timing of this consolidation must be tailored to national circumstances.
-- On China: "It's a move that is in China's best economic interest and it will help produce a more balanced global economy."
MONTEK SINGH AHLUWALIA, INDIA'S G20 DEPUTY
On financial sector reforms: "There is a lot that needs to be done. Clearly since different countries have different degrees of problems in the financial sector, the urgency with which each country has to do something differs."
-- On bank levy: "Our view is that it's not necessary for us, that doesn't stop anyone else from having it, and we've made it plain. It depends on what kind of a reference you have.
"If you have a reference that says: some countries want to do it, and others don't, and countries are free to do what they like, that's easy to do."
On Afghanistan: "Everybody recognizes that the challenges there remain significant ... (and) pretty severe. That said, I think there's a general recognition around the G8 table that we have to continue to put our shoulder to the wheel to ultimately ensure that what we leave behind is a stable Afghanistan ... and not a potential source of terrorism or a potential failed state."
DIMITRI SOUDAS, SPOKESMAN FOR CANADA PRIME MINISTER HARPER
On economic recovery: "The prime minister also will point out that if the G20 is to be the premier international economic forum it will need to take further steps to protect the recovery and set in motion strong, sustainable and balanced growth."
-- On bank tax: "We fully understand that countries that had to use public funds to bail out their banks or countries where banks failed would want to impose a tax on their banks. There will be a discussion about it. I think the G20 can play a role to create a framework on this issue but the bottom line is that, as we have always said, the approach to take will be determined at the national level."
-- Financial reform: "Obviously there are certain issues like reforming international financial institutions ... where we believe things can move ahead a bit faster, a bit more aggressive in order to ensure we close the loop on these things and prevent similar circumstances to occur."
