(Reuters) - The global economy continued to contract in July as a broad-based stabilisation in manufacturing was offset by ongoing recession in the service sector, JP Morgan said on Wednesday.
The Global Total Output index, produced by JP Morgan with research and supply management organisations, was 48.2 in July, marginally up from 48.1 in June, but firmly below the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction for the fourteenth month.
"July PMI data point to a two-speed recovery in the global economy. Manufacturing moved firmly into expansion territory ... In comparison, the small move down of the service sector PMI was a disappointment," said David Hensley, a director at JP Morgan.
"After rising through much of 2009-to-date, the global service sector PMI activity and employment indexes edged down in July. However, the trend towards recovery should resume later in Q3," Hensley said. Earlier data showed the deep recession in the 16-nation euro zone's dominant service sector eased in July while in the UK the sector grew at its fastest pace in 17 months.
However the United States service sector, which represents about 80 percent of U.S. economic activity, contracted at a faster pace in July than the previous month. The index combines survey data from countries including the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia.
