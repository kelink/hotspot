TREASURIES-Edge up in Asia, job market concerns persist

(Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries edged up in Asia on Wednesday, recovering some of the previous day's losses, amid concerns ahead of private-sector employment data that a tough job market could undermine an economic recovery.
Figures on pending homes sales offered more evidence that the struggling U.S. housing market, which led the world's largest economy into recession, might be starting to recover.
"The U.S. economic recovery looks very fragile because the labour market is still deteriorating," said a senior manager of the foreign bond investment group at a Japanese life insurer.
The manager said the yield of the 10-year Treasury note would likely stay below 3.75 percent for a while, given little macroeconomic incentive for many market players to push yields higher above June's high around 4 percent despite recent strong stock gains.
ADP national employment data, due at 1215 GMT, is expected to show the economy lost 345,000 private-sector jobs in July. That would be less than the 473,000 shed in June.
The Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index for July, due at 1400 GMT, is forecast to rise to 48.0 from 47.0 the month before.
The benchmark 10-year notes rose 3/32 in price to yield 3.679 percent US10YT=RR, down a basis point from late New York trade.
The two-year notes edged up 1/32 in price to yield 1.205 percent US2YT=RR, down about 2 basis points. The 30-year bonds rose 5/32 in price to yield 4.458 percent US30YT=RR, down a basis point.
Treasuries could come under pressure when the government announces the size of next week's refunding later on Wednesday.
The U.S. Treasury Department plans to ramp up sales of inflation-protected bonds and will announce the move as part of its announcement on funding, The Wall Street Journal said on Tuesday. The paper said China is among investors that have indicated they want to buy more of the securities.[ID:nN04187539]
Separately, the Federal Reserve is slated to buy Treasuries on Wednesday, part of a $300 billion programme aimed at holding down long-term interest rates and stimulating the economy. (Editing by Chris Gallagher)
