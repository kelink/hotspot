The new estimate for total mining capital expenditure for the 12 months to June 30, 2010, of A$32.10 billion, was 6.1 percent lower the previous estimate.
Andrew Hanlan, a senior economist at Westpac Banking Corp, said that while some near-term resilience in mining investment could be expected, given a record pipeline of infrastructure work, there was likely to be a correction in calendar year 2010 and into 2011.
