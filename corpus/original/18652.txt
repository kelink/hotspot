Shares of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America were up 16 percent at $14.70 in pre-market trade on Thursday.
Baird analyst David George said, "Despite the stock's move in recent days, we now find the risk/reward of the stock to be attractive given BAC's manageable capital needs."
Regulators have told Bank of America it needs $34 billion, while Citigroup needs $5 billion and auto and mortgage lender GMAC LLC needs $11.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. [ID:nN06286741]
"While this is not an insignificant number, we believe BAC has adequate levers to pull in order to fill the capital hole, including the potential conversion of $33 billion of non-government preferred stock, the sale of unlocked shares in China Construction Bank, as well as Columbia Management," the analyst said.
Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz on Wednesday said banks undergoing the U.S. government stress tests will need a total of $75 billion in capital, with Bank of America having the largest need.
George said the core earnings power of Bank of America is intact, and he raised his price target to $18 from $9.
