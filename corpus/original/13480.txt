(Reuters) - Mid-sized Chinese brokerage, Industrial Securities, is eyeing a 5 billion yuan ($732 million) domestic stock initial public offering (IPO) and has hired UBS AG's (
) China investment banking venture as the lead underwriter, influential magazine Caijing reported on Thursday.
The brokerage, based in the southern Chinese province of Fujian, hopes to raise funds to supplement operational capital, the magazine said on its website, www.caijing.com.cn.
"As the listing plan has just started, concerned parties cannot give an accurate timetable for the IPO," it said.
Industrial Securities' officials were not immediately available for comment.
Its recently published interim earnings results showed it made a net profit of 545 million yuan in the first half of this year on operational income of 1.41 billion yuan, with net assets at 4.4 billion yuan by the end of June.
China has eight listed brokerages, but only one, CITIC Securities (
), went public by floating IPO shares. Six others chose backdoor listings via acquisitions of listed companies and the other transformed itself into a brokerage from a previous trust firm.
Now a slew of other brokerages are considering IPOs as China's generally booming stock market over the past several years is offering the firms good opportunities for expansion.
Among them, Everbright Securities and China Merchants Securities have won initial approval from the regulator to list and are expected to launch their IPOs as soon as next week. ($1=6.83 Yuan) (Reporting by Lu Jianxin and Jacqueline Wong)
