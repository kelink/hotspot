(Reuters) - Roy Bennett, an ally of Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai and senior official of the Movement for Democratic Change, stands trial on terrorism charges on Monday.
- The MDC's treasurer-general, he was arrested in February, accused of plotting against President Robert Mugabe's government.
- The charges were that he illegally possessed arms for the purposes of committing terrorism and banditry. Bennett denies the charges, which carry a possible death sentence.
- Bennett was destined to be deputy agriculture minister in the power-sharing unity government of the MDC and Mugabe's ZANU-PF, but was detained before ministers were sworn in.
- Roy Leslie Bennett was born in 1957 and was one of the country's top coffee growers before his eastern farm was seized as part of Mugabe's land redistribution programme.
- Chinamasa called Bennett's forefathers "thieves and murderers", saying he deserved to lose his farm after benefiting from a British colonial system that robbed black Zimbabweans of their land. In the heat of the argument, Bennett pushed the minister to the ground.
