Officially, China is still refusing to budge in its attempt to secure a 40 percent cut in the price of iron ore from the big three suppliers -- BHP Billiton (
) of Australia and Brazil's Vale (
) -- but with less than two weeks to go before negotiations end, individual steel mills have been seeking their own agreements.
Citing Zhu Fengliang, secretary general of the Shanxi Iron and Steel Association, the Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper reported on Friday that a number of steel enterprises in the province had already jointly negotiated supply deals with overseas miners.
Vale executives refused to confirm the deals, but the China Iron and Steel Association responded by saying their validity would not be recognised.
It added that it could revoke the import licenses of any enterprise that undermined China's negotiating position by signing its own supply contracts.
However, traders have suggested the association was likely to turn a blind eye to individual steel mills signing independent long-term contracts with foreign miners should the negotiations end without reaching a final settlement.
