UPDATE 1-HSBC raises Mexico equities to 'overweight'

(Reuters) - HSBC has raised its rating on Mexican equities to "overweight" from "neutral," saying the country was its top Latin American pick because of better prospects for economic growth in the United States.
"We believe a turnaround in U.S. growth ought to disproportionately benefit Mexican GDP growth and Mexican equities among the Latam countries," HSBC said in a report late on Thursday.
But the Mexican currency has outperformed its peers since last week, helped by bets that a rebound in the U.S. economy could fuel a recovery in Mexican exports, more than 80 percent of which are sent to its northern neighbor.
"To the extent that U.S. industrial production now begins to pick up -- particularly when concern about China is increasing -- Mexico has a good opportunity to outperform," wrote emerging markets strategist John Lomax.
Data on Friday showed U.S. industrial output gained for the first time in nine months in July from June, beating market estimates.
Earlier this week, Chinese stocks slid nearly 5 percent on worries that authorities could begin restricting credit that has helped fuel stock gains.
HSBC said that if China's economy overheats, it will hurt the bullish outlook for other emerging market economies with strong links to China like Brazil. (Reporting by Lizbeth Salazar. Editing by Robert MacMillan)
