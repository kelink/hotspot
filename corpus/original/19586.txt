China buying boosts gold to 3-week high

(Reuters) - Gold scaled a three-week high on Friday after China said its gold reserves have risen sharply, raising the prospect of further purchases by Beijing and other central banks as well as investment funds.
Gold mining stocks, measured by the Gold Bugs index .HUI, jumped 7 percent after China revealed it had secretly raised its gold reserves by 75 percent since 2003 to 1,054 tonnes, confirming speculation it had been buying in the market for some years.
China's news lifted gold in spite of a rise in U.S. stock markets. Reassuring economic data suggests the recession may be abating and that optimism has dampened investor enthusiasm for gold, a safe haven in times of economic uncertainty.
Spot gold was at $912.10 an ounce at 3:11 p.m. EDT (1911 GMT), up 1.1 percent from its late Thursday quote of $902 in New York. Earlier on Friday it hit $913.50, a rise of more than 5 percent this week and the highest price since April 2.
"China is protecting its huge currency risk by diversifying with gold as well as other currencies like the euro. This is prudent," said Frank Holmes, chief executive officer of U.S. Global Investors, which manages more than $2 billion in fund assets.
Analysts said that China was evaluating its reserve asset mix in the wake of recent massive liquidity addition by central banks, which has the potential of debasing world currencies.
"This is an indication that monetary authorities around the world, not just investors, are also viewing gold in a better light," said Jeffrey Christian, managing director of CPM Group.
China's reserves are now the fifth biggest in the world, with only six countries holding more than 1,000 tonnes.
But some analysts were wary, and said the Chinese buying was the equivalent of less than 100 tonnes a year.
"One would expect them to have bought more, actually," said Jon Nadler, senior analyst at Kitco Bullion Dealers.
CHINA'S RESERVE GROWING
China gold reserves now accounts for only about 1.6 percent of its total foreign exchange holdings and is little more than one-tenth of the value of the U.S. gold reserve, the world's biggest. It also means gold has slipped as a share of China's total reserves from about 2 percent, based on end-2003 prices.
"(It is) not so surprising considering the very rapid increase in the overall level of Chinese external reserves, that it probably increased its holdings of all forms of reserves," John Lipsky, first deputy managing director of the IMF, said on Friday, when asked whether China would be in the market to buy 403 tonnes of gold owned by the IMF.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) last year approved the sale of 403 tonnes of gold from its stocks of 3,217 tonnes (103.4 million ounces) as part of a plan to put its finances on a sounder footing and create an endowment with the proceeds.
Selling IMF gold requires ratification by the legislatures of member countries, including the U.S. Congress, a process that is expected to take at least several months.
China's increase in gold reserves and the possibility that it might buy more of the yellow metal runs against the recent trend in the market, as seen in the holdings by the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, the SPDR Gold Trust.
SPDR's gold holdings fell to 1,104.45 tonnes as of Thursday, down 1.53 tonnes, or 0.1 percent, from Wednesday, extending a decline that began last week in the biggest unwinding of positions seen since September. <GOL/SPDR>
Silver, tracking gold, rose to $12.93 an ounce, the highest since April 3 and was last at $12.87 an ounce, up 1.0 percent from its previous finish of $12.74.
Palladium was at $232.00 an ounce, up 0.7 percent from its previous finish of $230.50 an ounce, and platinum at $1,174.00 an ounce, down 0.4 percent from its late Thursday quote of $1,178.50.
