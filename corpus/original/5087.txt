) and up from about 400 in 2009, said Johnny Ng, AT&T's general manager for the Greater China region.
"Some companies in China are looking to expand through acquisitions, and this will help them become large multi-nationals, and that's our focus," Ng said in an interview.
Revenue from the region in the first nine months of 2010 rose about 21 percent, faster than the 13 percent recorded in the full year of 2009, Ng said.
While China is the world's mobile market, it is largely off-limits to foreign operators such as AT&T and Vodafone (

China is a total one-way street when it comes to business. All the money comes in and they won¡¯t let any out. Mr. Bernanke, please continue to help grease the wheels of the American economy! Print MUCH MORE money for the Chinese as we all know they will never send it back to the USA¡­

drgalvez, China is by far the worlds largest mobile phone market; more that twice that of the US. I pay 20 USD per month for a package deal that includes my cell phone, house phone and internet. We can assume that China mobile is still making a profit off of me. So say you are paying about 200USD for the same service in the US, we can assume that the US market is about 1000% over priced. So much for a competitive market creating fair prices for customers. If you are paying 100+ USD per month for TNT and the Food network, you should be angry.
