(Reuters) - Thailand's IRPC IRPC.BK, operator of Southeast Asia's biggest integrated petrochemical complex, plans to spend $1.2 billion by 2014 on investments and expects its margins to increase in the third quarter, its chief executive said on Tuesday.
Given higher petrochemical product prices and growing global demand, the company expects double-digit gross integrated margins from its petrochemical and refinery businesses this quarter, chief executive officer Pailin Chuchottaworn told reporters.
"The industry has hit bottom since late last year, while demand was strong, especially from China where the demand was surging, above its highest hit in 2005," Pailin said.
"As we already got orders to September, we feel confident that our margin should show a double-digit figure in the third quarter," Pailin added.
IRPC reported gross integrated margins of $9.1 a barrel in the second quarter, up from $8.4 a barrel in the first quarter.
The company said in June it expected to beat analysts' 2009 net profit forecasts' 4.6 billion baht ($135 million).
IRPC, 36 percent owned by Thailand's top energy firm PTT PCL PTT.BK, posted a net loss of 18 billion baht last year as falling oil prices hit margins and caused inventory losses.
To boost its capability, IRPC planned to spend $1.2 billion in five years. The proceed would be mainly used to improve its refinery plant, expand production capacity, and port maintenance.
PTT is studying the possibility of merging its four main subsidiaries in a bid to cut costs and boost efficiency, its president said on Thursday.
The companies involved are PTT Aromatics and Refining PTTAR.BK, top refiner Thai Oil TOP.BK, IRPC IRPC.BK and PTT Chemical PTTC.BK.
On Tuesday, IRPC shares ended unchanged at 3.44 baht, while the Thai main stock index .SETI rose 0.35 percent. ($1=34.01 Baht) (Reporting by Pisit Changplayngam; Writing by Arada Kultawanich; Editing by Jason Szep)
