* Project to be divided into three phases (Updates share move, adds background, LOS ANGELES dateline)
As the world's top greenhouse gas polluter, China is trying to catch up in a global race to find alternatives to fossil fuels, and many believe it will become a major market for solar power.
Since China announced its subsidy plan, domestic solar power companies including LDK Solar Co Ltd (
), Suntech Power Holdings Co Ltd (
), and ReneSola Ltd SOLA.L have announced plans to develop big solar power plants in China.
The plant will be located in CPT, which is in Inner Mongolia, and the project will be divided into three phases, Canadian Solar said.
A total of 100 MW of the photovoltaic system will be installed in the first phase, which will run from September 2009 to December 2011. About 200 MW each will be installed in the second and third phases, the company said.
The project is subject to a feasibility study and government approvals, the company said.
Shares of Canadian Solar were down about 1.3 percent at $14.74 on Wednesday on Nasdaq. The stock, which has risen nearly five-fold from a March year low, is still off more than 50 percent from an August 2008 year high.
