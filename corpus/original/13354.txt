(Reuters) - Shares in Russian potash miner Uralkali soared after the company said on Friday that its Belarussian sales joint venture agreed to sell 675,000 tonnes of potash fertiliser to India at $460 per tonne.
"The price is quite low, but they have a contract, and this means their utilisation rates can increase," Merrill Lynch analyst Pavel Simonenko said.
Uralkali's London-listed GDRs were up 5.8 percent to $17.12 at 1408 GMT.
Under the terms of the agreement, Uralkali's Belarusian Potash Company (BPC) joint venture will deliver 675,000 tonnes of potash fertiliser from July, 2009 until March, 2010.
Rival Silvinit SILV.RTS earlier this month agreed to sell 850,000 tonnes to India at $460 per tonne, causing a sharp drop in potash miners across the globe since the price was about 25 percent below expected levels. [ID:nN10522755]
In 2008, spot potash prices soared above the $1,000 per tonne level as demand outstripped supply.
