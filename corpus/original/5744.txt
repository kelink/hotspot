Factbox: Ties and tensions between China and Japan

(Reuters) - Japanese and Chinese leaders met for the first time since a feud over boat collisions near disputed islands in the East China Sea last month soured relations, and agreed that improving strained ties was vital.
But both Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, who met on Monday in Brussels, stressed their claims to the islands, suggesting that tensions between Asia's top two economies were far from over.
ECONOMIC POWERHOUSES, SHIFTING RANKINGS
* Preliminary statistics indicate China has edged past Japan to become the world's second-biggest economy, with the United States remaining the world's biggest by far.
Japan's second-quarter unadjusted gross domestic product (GDP) totaled $1.2883 trillion on a nominal dollar basis, against China's second-quarter unadjusted GDP of $1.3369 trillion. Japan and China together account for about 17 percent of the world's output.
* China-Japan trade rebounded in the first half of 2010 after slumping in the global financial crisis. Bilateral trade reached 12.6 trillion yen ($151 billion) in value in the first half, a jump of 34.5 percent over the same period last year, according to Japanese statistics.
Two-way trade totaled 21.7 trillion yen in 2009. China has been Japan's biggest trading partner since 2009.
* China and Japan are the world's first- and second-biggest holders of foreign reserves.
* A series of strikes in China has hit Japanese firms in recent months, including suppliers to Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Corp.
* Japan invaded and occupied part of China from 1931 to 1945. Bitterness over Japan's wartime atrocities has faded as a diplomatic flashpoint, but still underpins widespread Chinese public distrust of Japan.
* China has criticized high-profile visits by Japanese politicians to Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine for the war dead. Among those honored at the shrine are 14 Class A war criminals convicted by an Allied tribunal after World War Two.
Junichiro Koizumi, Japanese prime minister from 2001 to 2006, made annual visits to the shrine while in office but his successors have stayed away.
TAIWAN, NORTH KOREA
* China wants Japan to clearly back Beijing's "one China" policy. Japan says it accepts that, but many politicians and businesses have close ties with Taiwan, a former Japanese colony.
* China and Japan are both part of stalled six-party talks seeking to end North Korea's nuclear arms program. Japan is more critical of North Korea and joined international condemnation of it over the sinking of a South Korean navy ship in March. China, the North's main diplomatic and economic backer, instead urged restraint by all sides.
* The two countries are at odds over China's exploration for natural gas in the East China Sea. In 2008, they agreed on principles to solve the feud by jointly developing gas fields. Progress has been slow and Japan has accused China of drilling for gas in violation of the deal.
Those seas are at the center of a territorial dispute between the two countries focused on a group of uninhabited islets, known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, over which both countries claim sovereignty.
* Japan has been worried by China's military modernization, especially its double-digit defense spending increase and expanding naval reach. In May, Tokyo lodged a protest with Beijing, claiming a Chinese ship had violated Japan's sovereign rights by approaching a Japanese survey vessel.
