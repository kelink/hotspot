(Reuters) - Peru, the world's No. 2 copper producer, could see its output of the red metal rise by nearly 70 percent in the next five years.
The increase would come from expansions at existing mines and from new projects, which are moving forward despite the relatively low price of copper and the challenges of developing deposits in Peru. For more see [ID:nN21377830].
The estimate for a 70 percent increase was based on projects with forecasted production data and start dates. Included in the calculation were the Toromocho, Galeno, Tia Maria, Toquepala and Las Bambas developments.
) has two projects in Peru -- Tia Maria and Toquepala. The company says Tia Maria will be up and running by 2011 and turn out 120,000 tonnes of copper per year. An expansion on its existing Toquepala mine is expected to lift output by some 40,000 tonnes, by the second half of 2012.
* Mining giant Xstrata XTA.L sees production at its Las Bambas project by the end of 2014 and its Antapaccay expansion operational by the end of 2012, or beginning of 2013. Feasibility studies on both projects are expected at the end of this year, when the company has said it will give official output estimates, though it has said Las Bambas will likely have a per year production of nearly 300,000 tonnes.
), the world's fourth-largest diversified miner, has two developments in Peru -- Quellaveco, which has an annual forecast of 225,000 tonnes, and Michiquillay, which is expected to produce 300,000 tonnes per year. Both projects are unapproved at this point and neither has an expected start date.
* Rio Tinto's (
* Chinalco's Toromocho is scheduled to begin construction this year and production in 2012. It has an estimated cost of $2.2 billion and is forecast to produce some 210,000 tonnes of copper per year in the first ten years of its expected three-decade-long life.
* Minmetals' Galeno is expected to produce some 140,000 tonnes of copper per year and 200,000 tonnes annually in its first five years. The project is still in the study stage, but the company has said it could be up and running by 2014. (Reporting by Dana Ford)
