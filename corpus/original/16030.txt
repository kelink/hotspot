Nalco CEO says China demand recovers, US at bottom

(Reuters) - Nalco Holding Co NLC.N, a provider of water treatment services and chemicals to the petrochemical sector, is seeing signs of demand recovering in China after a steep decline earlier this year, its Chief Executive said on Monday.
"The Chinese government has really taken a strong position on wanting to improve the environment in China and that's opening up business opportunities for us, particularly in industrial water treatment," Erik Fyrwald told Reuters television on Monday.
"In China, we saw a very steep drop off at the end of last year through Q1, that's starting to bounce back."
Fyrwald, who spoke on the sidelines of the National Summit in Detroit, said he thought U.S. demand was close to bottoming, while the company was seeing "continued challenges" in Europe.
"In the U.S., (demand is) kind of bottoming," he said. "There's still some unemployment to work through the system so we're not declaring victory by any means, but at least it seems to be finding a bottom."
Fyrwald said rising oil prices were a boost to the company, which generates 40 percent of its sales from the oil and gas sector, but another of its major markets, paper and pulp, remained under pressure.
"The paper sector is very challenged, particularly in Europe," Fyrwald said. "In North America, we feel like it's somewhat bottomed out. Asia we see starting to come back in paper and that's where we see growth opportunities."
Separately, Fyrwald said Nalco's recent $1.25 billion debt refinancing pushes out maturities on much of Nalco's debt to 2016 and 2017.
Asked if Nalco needed to issue any debt in the near term, he said: "We don't have any needs for any number of years and our free cash flow allows us to actually pay down some debt." (Reporting by Nick Zieminski; Editing by Andre Grenon)
