Brazil's currency, the real BRBY, reversed course from earlier in the day and weakened 0.29 percent to 1.722 per dollar. The greenback firmed against a basket of major currencies .DXY on Wednesday.
The real has strengthened about 35 percent so far this year as investors have poured dollars into the country. Those gains prompted the government last month to institute a 2 percent tax on capital inflows on equities and fixed-income investments, and talk has abounded about potential further measures.
"I think there's going to be further capital controls," said Kathryn Rooney, a senior emerging markets strategist with Bulltick Capital Markets.
