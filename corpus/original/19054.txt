Gates told CNN that he has been surprised by the limited scope of criticism aimed so far at his recommendations for the Pentagon budget for fiscal year 2010, which begins Oct. 1.
"Where I have heard criticism, it has come from predictable places. There also have been some important voices raised in support," he said in the interview, which was taped last week.
"I'm relatively optimistic, actually. I think we've presented, as one news magazine referred to it, a radically sane set of proposals. They don't represent a cut, and where we have eliminated one program, you have added to others."
A more detailed version of the Obama budget is expected to arrive as early as this week on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers decide what will, and will not be, included in the final version.
The Gates proposals scale back or eliminate spending programs for costly weapons systems, while placing greater emphasis on irregular warfare and care for wounded troops and their families.
"At the end of the day, 50 percent of our procurement budget is still for these high-tech modernization programs, about 40 percent for dual-purpose capabilities ... and about 10 percent for irregular conflicts," Gates said.
"The notion that I've sort of abandoned looking at future threats is contrary to reality, and I look forward to the opportunity to go to (Capitol) Hill and make that case." (Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Will Dunham)
