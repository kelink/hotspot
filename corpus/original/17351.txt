(Reuters) - Standard Bank (
), Africa's biggest bank by assets, scaled back its full-year expectations and said trading conditions were tougher than anticipated as South Africa slipped into its first recession in 17 years.
Standard Bank, which is 20 percent owned by China's biggest lender ICBC (
), said on Thursday normalised headline earnings per share for the first four months of 2009 fell 18 percent as bad loan rates rose.
"Given the trend established in the first four months, it is unlikely that last year's normalised headline earnings per share will be achieved," Standard Bank said in a statement.
Nigel McKenzie, a research analyst at Stanlib, said the first six months was always going to be difficult for the bank from a comparative perspective because the first half of 2008 was still a period of relative strength.
"So I wouldn't expect full-year numbers to be as bad as (the first) six months of 2009. I think the trend is more or less in line with what we were expecting and the read-through for all banks, I think it's quite similar," he said.
Shares in Standard Bank dipped 1 percent to 84.35 rand by 0806 GMT, slightly weaker than the banking sector .JBANK.
Sim Tshabalala, one of Standard Bank's deputy chief executives, told Reuters earlier this month 2009 was proving "tougher than anybody expected".
Its core personal and business banking unit reported an 18 percent drop in headline earnings to April 2009, while its corporate and investment banking business saw earnings rise 4 percent.
