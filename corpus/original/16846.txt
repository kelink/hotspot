Rio, Chinalco may revise $19.5b deal before June 14

MELBOURNE, June 4
) and China's Chinalco may revise their planned $19.5 billion tie-up before a June 14 deadline, to avoid a further delay in Australian government approval, a source close to the transaction said.
Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) is due to give its recommendation on the Chinese state-owned company's investment to Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan by June 14. Swan has the final say on whether the deal will go ahead.
If the deal was revised after being approved, it would need to be resubmitted to FIRB as a fresh proposal and could face further delays.
"If there was a chance the deal needs to be amended, the companies would notify FIRB of that before a FIRB decision on the current application," the source said.
It would be up to the FIRB to decide whether to approve the revised application by the current June 14 deadline, or extend the review, depending on how substantive the changes are, the source and another close to the process said.
"Rio and Chinalco would prefer if the clock remained ticking on the current timetable," the source said.
Chinalco declined to comment on the status of negotiations on the deal, which would be China's biggest foreign investment, and Rio Tinto's spokeswoman in Australia did not immediately respond to an email and telephone calls for comment. (Reporting by Sonali Paul; Editing by Jonathan Standing)
