(Reuters) - Bed springs and store shelving maker Leggett & Platt Inc (
) post a quarterly profit that beat market expectations, helped by cost savings amid continued weakness in consumer demand for household items.
Leggett & Platt, which laid off 9 percent of its workforce earlier this year and closed stores to battle slumping sales, said earnings per share of $2 is achievable by 2012, as markets improve.
"They probably have a pretty good idea about margins," Kansas City Capital Associates analyst Michael Smith told Reuters by phone. He added that the $2 earnings per share target seems achievable.
Sales slumped 28 percent to $809.9 million, missing the Wall Street target of $838.5 million, but operating expenses fell 20 percent to $84.8 million.
"It looks like sales are still a little dumpy for Leggett & Platt, but they certainly did a good job on gross margins and selling, general and administrative expenses lines," analyst Smith said.
Third-quarter gross margins improved to 23.1 percent, from 18.3 percent, a year ago.
The Carthage, Missouri-based company forecast full-year 2009 earnings per share from continuing operations of 65 cents to 75 cents, up from its prior view 55 cents to 70 cents a share, buoyed by improved margin expectations. Its sales outlook remained unchanged at $3 billion.
Analysts on average were looking for a profit of 64 cents a share, on revenue of $3.04 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
For the third-quarter, net income rose to $54.3 million, or 34 cents a share, from $32.7 million, or 20 cents a share, a year ago.
Shares of Leggett & Platt, which have risen 31 percent in the last six months, closed at $19.41 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Viraj Nair in Bangalore; Editing by Unnikrishnan Nair)
