Following are details on what Asia is doing to combat and ward off the new swine flu virus, after battling deadly viruses such as the H5N1 bird flu and SARS in recent years:
- A medical centre has been set up at Kabul airport to deal with possible cases, but the country cannot afford screening equipment and is relying on other countries to scan outbound passengers
- The WHO has donated $500,000 worth of Tamiflu, which will cover 30,360 people
- Stockpiled 8.7 million doses of the antivirals Tamiflu and Relenza, enough to cover 41 percent of its 21 million population
- Screening incoming passengers at all airports, seaports and border transit points since the outbreak of the virus
- Health ministry officials say the country has sufficient supplies of oseltamivir, or Tamiflu, which is produced locally
- Screening incoming visitors at main airports in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, home of the Angkor temples, the country's biggest tourist destination
- Maintains a stockpile of 15,750 packets of Tamiflu
- Stepped up personal hygiene campaigns, checks at airports, including requiring visitors to fill out health status declarations
- Instead of quarantining close contacts of patients, they can stay home but will need to report daily to government clinics where they will be given prophylactic drugs
- Stockpiles of Tamiflu enough for 33.8 million people, in a country with a total population of 128 million. Government has ordered an amount for another 8.3 million citizens. Central government has enough Relenza for 2.68 million people, while local govts are either holding or have purchased additional Relenza for another 1.33 million citizens
- No plans to increase stockpiles of antibiotics, but the country is working to produce new H1N1 vaccines
- Apart from renewed calls for personal hygiene, about 4,500 schools in western Japan are closed until May 22
- Has a national stockpile of nearly 1.4 million doses of Tamiflu and Relenza, which will cover just under one-third of the 4.3 million population
- Health authorities have been screening flights from North America, regarded as the region of greatest risk
- Tamiflu stockpile estimated at 1.17 million capsules. Government has placed additional order of 200,000 capsules. The Philippines has a population of 91 million
- Stepped up surveillance and screening of incoming passengers; Filipinos returning from abroad are told to monitor their health for 10 days and seek medical help if they show influenza-like symptoms
- Current Tamiflu stockpile covers 2.5 million people. Has signed deals to secure an additional 2.7 million doses of Tamiflu and Relenza, which would increase its total stockpile to cover 10 percent of its population of about 49 million people
- No orders to produce vaccines, though the government has talked to pharmaceuticals about the possibility
- Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's largest city of more than 8 million people, has stocks of Tamiflu enough for 1 million
- Health ministers from ASEAN, China, Japan and South Korea pledge to boost drug stockpiles, share essential supplies and tighten surveillance against a virus that poses an "imminent health threat"
- Has 500,000 courses of antivirals stockpiled in Singapore and another 500,000 distributed among ASEAN member states (Reporting by Asian bureaux; Editing by Valerie Lee)
