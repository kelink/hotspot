(Reuters) - Hong Kong shares advanced 5.5 percent on Monday in huge turnover, sending the main index to its highest level since mid-October 2008, as data from China and the U.S. suggested the global economy was on the mend.
Coal and steel stocks rallied strongly after China's official purchasing manager's index (PMI) for April rose for a fifth straight month, adding to evidence the country would make an early recovery from the global economic slump.

Most investors shrugged off concern over a global H1N1 flu pandemic even after Hong Kong's government on Friday confirmed the city's first case of the flu on Friday in a Mexican traveller and sealed off a hotel, quarantining 200 guests and 100 staff for seven days.
"The flu fears seem to be fading as the danger of it spreading seems to be lower now. On the other hand, we have China's PMI data, which seems to signal continued recovery for the economy, yet another reason to stay bullish," said Castor Pang, strategist with Sun Hung Kai Financial.
