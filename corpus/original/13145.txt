(Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries edged up in Asia on Wednesday with longer-dated bonds holding firm, but many investors sat on sidelines ahead of five-year debt auction after soft two-year sale the day before revived supply worries.
* Lacklustre results at Tuesday's sale of two-year debt raised questions about how easily it will be to find buyers for the rest of this week's record $115 billion worth of bond supply, which also includes a sale of seven-year notes on Thursday.
* Below-average foreign demand and the fact participants bargained for a higher-than-expected yield at Tuesday's sale suggested the robust demand seen at auctions in recent weeks is waning.
* Investors were focusing to see if China moves any differently in purchasing Treasuries after the country concluded two days of the Strategic and Economic Dialogue with the United States on Tuesday, said Yoshio Takahashi, a fixed-income strategist for Barclays Capital Japan.
* Overseas central banks, particularly in Asia, have been huge buyers of U.S. debt in recent years and own more than a quarter of marketable Treasuries. China is the biggest such buyer.
* The benchmark 10-year notes rose 2/32 in price to yield 3.684 percent US10YT=RR, down a basis point from late New York trade. The yield of the new two-year Treasury notes auctioned on Tuesday stood at 1.131 percent US2YT=RR.
* The spread between the two- and 10-year yields stayed below 268 basis points at the start of the week, indication curve flattening pressure was intact.
* The 30-year bonds rose 10/32 in price to yield 4.541 percent US30YT=RR, down 2 basis points.
* On Wednesday, investors will also look to data on durable goods orders for June due at 1230 GMT, while The Federal Reserve's Beige Book description of economic conditions is due at 1800 GMT, a hour after the auction results. (Editing by Edwina Gibbs)
