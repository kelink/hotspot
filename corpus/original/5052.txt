WikiLeaks' Assange: China is our real enemy

(Reuters) - China is the worst state offender in terms of censorship but WikiLeaks is getting past its attempts to restrict access, the website's founder Julian Assange said in an interview published on Wednesday.
Assange, whose website has angered and embarrassed Washington by releasing confidential U.S. diplomatic cables, said China was the main technological enemy of WikiLeaks, not the United States.
"China has aggressive and sophisticated interception technology that places itself between every reader inside China and every information source outside China," Assange told Britain's New Statesman magazine.
"We've been fighting a running battle to make sure we can get information through and there are now all sorts of ways Chinese readers can get on to our site," he said in extracts of the interview published on the magazine's website.
U.S. officials have been examining whether criminal charges can be brought against Assange since WikiLeaks began publishing the cables. He again denied working with Bradley Manning, a U.S. Army intelligence analyst suspected of leaking the files.
On Tuesday, a U.S. court ordered microblogging site Twitter to hand over account information on Assange and Manning as well as other WikiLeaks supporters. Assange accused U.S. authorities of using Manning, who was arrested in the first half of last year, to build a case against him.
"Cracking Manning is the first step," he said. "The aim is clearly to break him and force a confession that he somehow conspired with me to harm the national security of the United States."
So far WikiLeaks has issued just a small proportion of the 250,000 cables it has obtained. Assange denied that the website was in trouble and repeated previous statements that files would still be released whatever happened to him or WikiLeaks.
"There are 504 U.S. embassy cables on one broadcasting organization and there are cables on Murdoch and News Corp," he said. WikiLeaks has previously said it would release documents relating to a major U.S. bank, believed to be Bank of America.
His lawyers warned on Tuesday that, if extradited, he could eventually end up in the United States facing the death penalty.
"They don't want the public to know these things and scapegoats must be found," Assange told the New Statesman.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
How many other countries will want this guy taken out? China does not fallow international laws in cases that benefit them, this is one. So now he has the USA, Sweden, Iran, Russia, and China now unhappy with his espionage. If one fails, the next may not. One eventually will. Yes, most want you DEAD. You better hope the USA wins. We will only jail you at Guantanamo with little non-permanent torture. If China, Russia, or Iran gets a hold of you, you will wish you were killed. Now he claims ¡°insurance¡±? What a joke. That will slow down the USA government as much as a gofer hole slows an elephant. They steamroll bigger mole hills every day. Once they get a ¡°legal¡± avenue, and they will, Guantanamo will have a new resident.

Julian Assange and WikiLeaks is a blessing, forcing all governments ¡ª including China ¡ª and large corporations to at least think about the way they do business and rule.

Future historians may credit Mr. Assange as the most significant 21st Century individual whose actions changed the future. This position will, indeed, be secured forever if he dies or is imprisoned because of his and WikiLeaks revalations.
