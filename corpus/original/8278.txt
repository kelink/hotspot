(Reuters) - Indian iron ore exports jumped an annual 88 percent in September as Chinese demand picked up, and partly reflected a statistical effect caused by a slump in the same month last year in the wake of the world economic crisis.
Exports climbed to 6.25 million tonnes in September from 3.33 million tonnes a year earlier, the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries (FIMI) said on Friday.
"There seems to be some additional demand for Indian ore from China," Glen Kalvampara, secretary, Goa Mineral Ore Exporters' Association, said.
Goa on the west coast of India contributes more than 40 percent of India's total iron ore exports of about 106 million tonnes a year.
"It appears there will be a marginal increase in exports from Goa," he said.
Exports during April to September were 45.03 million tonnes, up from 39.8 million tonnes in the same period a year ago, FIMI said, adding the figures were provisional.
