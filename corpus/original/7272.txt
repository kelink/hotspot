(Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday slapped additional duties of 43 to 289 percent on imports of more than $300 million worth of a steel product from China, the U.S. Commerce Department said.
Last week, the U.S. International Trade Commission approved duties ranging from 10 to 16 percent on some $2.74 billion worth of Chinese-made oil well tubing and casing in the biggest U.S. trade case against China.
The same day, the United Steelworkers union and four U.S. companies filed a new petition asking for duties of at least 109 to 274 percent on Chinese-made drill pipe.
U.S. producers including AWP Industries Inc, ITC Manufacturing Inc, J&L Wire Cloth Inc, Nashville Wire Products Mfg Co Inc, and Wireway Husky Corporation asked for duties last year after imports from China surged to $317 million in 2008 from almost $213 million in 2006.
Three other companies -- Dandong Riqian Logistics Equipment Co Ltd, Globsea Co Ltd and Ningbo Xinguang Rack Co Ltd -- were hit with a 46.78 percent preliminary duty.
Dalian Huameilong Metal Products Co Ltd got a preliminary rate of 50.95 percent, while all other Chinese producers or exporters received an initial duty of 289 percent.
Chinese producers and exporters could still escape the duties if the U.S. International Trade Commission determines U.S. producers have not been materially injured, or threatened with material injury, by the imports.
