BERLIN, July 12
) is readying an improved offer for General Motors unit Opel which foresees preserving all of its German plants, a newspaper reported on Sunday.
Without citing its sources, Germany's Bild am Sonntag said RHJ would require 3.8 billion euros ($5.3 billion) in government guarantees under its new plan and would cut just under 10,000 Opel jobs across Europe.
But the German government, which agreed to supply 1.5 billion euros in bridge financing to Opel while a deal was finalised, has said the race remains wide open.
It has encouraged rival bidders, such as RHJ, China's Beijing Automotive (BAIC) and Italy's Fiat SpA (
), to come back with improved offers, raising the pressure on Magna.
Reuters obtained a non-binding offer document from BAIC last week in which the group lays out a plan to use Opel's brand and technology to tap the huge Chinese market.
Despite noise from rivals, Magna has pressed ahead with talks on securing a framework deal with GM, which itself emerged from bankruptcy on Friday.
The head of Magna's European business told a German newspaper last week his company was on track to reach an agreement with GM and was targeting July 15 as a date for a preliminary deal.
But industry sources have told Reuters that Magna could delay a board meeting to approve the Opel deal which was originally set for July 14, suggesting a preliminary deal could be delayed beyond next week. (Writing by Noah Barkin; Editing by David Holmes)
