(Reuters) - Thailand's top coal miner, Banpu BANP.BK, said on Monday its second-quarter earnings rose a higher-than-expected 73 percent due to rising coal prices and strong income from its 50 percent owned BLCP power plant.
Banpu, also Indonesia's fourth-largest coal company with five coal mines there, is likely to report lower earnings growth in the second half because coal prices have fallen, but the outlook for next year is brighter, analysts said.
"After three years of sales volume declines, Banpu will see its combined sales volume grow 10 percent per annum in 2010-2012 thanks to Indonesian and Chinese mines," Thanachart Securities, a Thai partner of BNP Paribas, said in a note.
Banpu posted an April-June net profit of 3.98 billion baht ($117 million), or 14.65 baht per share, compared with 2.3 billion baht a year earlier and 4.8 billion in the first quarter, which is likely to be its best quarter for the year.
Revenue during the quarter rose 17 percent to nearly 13 billion baht as its average selling prices increased 10 percent to $73.89 per tonne, it said in a statement.
It also booked a gain of 3 billion baht, mainly from investments in the power business, up from 865 million baht a year earlier.
Banpu sells most of its coal through forward contracts. About 80 percent of its sales for 2009 were fixed at average prices of $70 per tonne, although average selling in the second half should be lower at $60-65 per tonne since world prices have fallen since July 2008, analysts said.
Coal prices may have hit bottom in the second quarter and could recover in line with oil prices, which should boost Banpu's selling prices next year, analysts said.
Its BLCP power plant will be shut down for maintenance in the fourth quarter, which should drag down second-half earnings.
Shares in Banpu, valued at $3.4 billion on the Thai bourse, have risen 41 percent in the past three months, outperforming a 22 percent rise on the overall market.
The results were published after the market closed. The stock ended down 3.3 percent on the day at 410 baht after hitting a 13-month high of 434 baht, while the overall market was 0.07 percent lower. ($1 =34.00 Baht) (Reporting by Khettiya Jittapong; Editing by Alan Raybould)
