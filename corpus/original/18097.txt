Gold hits 6-week high after U.S. inflation data

(Reuters) - Gold climbed to its highest level in six weeks on Friday after data showed U.S. core inflation in April rose more than expected, which boosted the precious metal's appeal as a hedge against rising prices.
Spot gold rallied to $933.65 an ounce, its highest price since March 27. It was at $930.70 an ounce at 3:45 p.m. EDT (1945 GMT), up 0.6 percent from its late Thursday quote of $925.35 in New York on Thursday.
U.S. core consumer prices rose faster than expected, up 0.3 percent in April from March. However, when food and energy are included, headline inflation was unchanged for the period.
"We've seen gold edging higher over the past week or so and quite a bit of that is inflation related," James Moore, an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com, said.
"Given the scale of quantitative easing that we have seen, the potential implications for inflation are quite large," Moore said.
The bullion market largely ignored news that China should boost its gold holdings to 3 percent of its total foreign exchange reserves within five years, compared with 1.6 percent now, a story sourced to the chairman of the China Gold Association.
In late April, China revealed that it had secretly raised its gold reserves by three-quarters since 2003, increasing its holdings to 1,054 tons and confirming years of speculation it had been buying.
German gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by a much larger than expected 3.8 percent in the first three months of 2009, tightening nerves after poor U.S. April retail sales reported earlier this week.
The world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, the SPDR Gold Trust, said holdings were unchanged at 1,105.62 tonnes on Thursday.
Gold may stay range-bound between $900 and $930 for a while because of a loss of momentum for the metal and as investors eye movements in the equities and oil markets, some analysts said.
Platinum was at $1,099.00 an ounce, down 1 percent from its late Thursday quote of $1,109.50.
The metal, used to clean exhaust fumes from vehicles, has lost about 3.5 percent over the past week, despite traditionally gaining ahead of the annual platinum week gathering in London, which begins on Monday with the launch of refiner Johnson Matthey's platinum report.
"Often, the run-up to Platinum Week sees prices of this pricey metal move higher as investors anticipate good news from the mix of data and commentary from Johnson Matthey. So the recent weakness of platinum is all the more unusual," John Reade, UBS head of metals strategy, said in a note.
"The sell-off appears to have been driven by investor selling -- We have also heard talk of bank and fund selling of OTC and futures positions in anticipation of GM's likely move into Chapter 11 sometime in the next few weeks," Reade said.

Palladium was at $221.00 an ounce, down 1.1 percent from its previous finish of $223.50.
