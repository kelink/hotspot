The company said it expected revenue to grow by an additional $100 million within three years as a result of the deal, which would help it make inroads into two markets where it has had little success previously.
Its unit in Japan could also see revenue grow ten-fold from 2008 levels to $50 million next year, as Sojitz and Nissho would help the company widen its distribution network in the world's second-largest economy.
"The Japanese market is not an easy one to break into, and the deal will help us there, especially in the corporate market," D-Link chief executive Tony Tsao told reporters at a news conference.
D-Link reported revenue of about T$33.04 billion ($1.01 billion) in 2008, and even if its Japanese revenue grows as expected, it would make up only about 5 percent of the company's total sales assuming there is no overall revenue growth.
The company is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings on Wednesday. It reported a loss of more than T$324 million for the first three months of the year, hit by a slowdown in consumer demand for technology buys.
D-Link made the announcement after the Taiwan stock market closed on Monday. Its shares were down 0.17 percent, roughly in line with a 0.30 percent decline on the benchmark TAIEX share index
