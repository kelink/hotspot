UPDATE 1-Air China slumps on debt fears from Cathay stake

(Reuters) - Air China (
) shares tumbled nearly 10 percent on Tuesday as investors feared China's biggest airline may have paid too much and taken on debt in raising its stake in Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific (
), which sold a 12.5 percent stake in Cathay to Air China for $808 million [ID:nT321641], also slumped more than 9 percent, while Cathay Pacific shares eased 1 percent.
Analysts said investors were worried about the likely debt that loss-making Air China might have to take on as part of the deal, and that it may have overpaid for the stake.
"The offer price was 1.3 times Cathay's book value last year, which is higher than our official 1-year price target of HK$9.69 per share," said Jay Ryu, head of regional transport research at Mirae Asset. "Perhaps Air China was looking at Cathay's valuation for a longer term."
The deal could help Cathay improve its ties with Air China and boost its share of the mainland travel market, analysts said.
"It could have a better foothold in China without paying an extra cost," Ryu said.
Investors, however, dumped CITIC Pacific shares over concerns about the loss of profit contributions from Cathay, one of Asia's stronger airlines.
Goldman Sachs raised CITIC Pacific's 2009 estimated per share earnings by 35 percent to factor in the disposal gain, but cut its 2010 estimates by 5 percent and 2011 by 11 percent to account for the lack of profit contribution from Cathay.
CITIC Pacific said it would get a HK$1 billion gain in the second half from the sale, which was announced on Monday.
"Although we estimate the disposal would not have a significant impact on CITIC's net asset value, we view it as in line with CITIC's reallocated resources to strengthen its core business," Goldman said in a note.
By 0352 GMT, Air China was off 5.5 percent, CITIC Pacific 8.1 percent and Cathay Pacific 0.9 percent, while the broader Hang Seng share index
