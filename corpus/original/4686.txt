(Reuters) - China's latest IPO frenzy has not done any major harm to its stock markets, an official from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said, indicating a repeat of a 2008 ban on new listings is unlikely for now.
"Judging from the secondary market performance of the new shares, the momentum of IPOs has not added too much pressure on the stock markets," Zhu Congjiu, assistant to the chairman of the CSRC, told reporters in Beijing on Monday.
The benchmark stock index on the Shanghai Stock Exchange fell 14 percent last year, making it one of the biggest declining stock markets globally and prompting worries that the securities regulator may stop approving new listings.
China was the world's largest IPO market in 2010, with 347 companies including Agricultural Bank of China (
The IPO pipeline remains busy so far in 2011, with 63 companies raising a combined 75.4 billion yuan in share sales, Thomson Reuters data showed.
Zhu said the CSRC will continue to support fundraising by small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) as well as by sectors that are considered strategic under the government's newly unveiled five-year development plan.
"The SMEs face great difficulty in trying to raise money and they are very important to the economy in terms of GDP growth, employment and earnings," said Zhu. "And we must support the development of the strategic sectors."
