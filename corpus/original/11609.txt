(Reuters) - U.S. 10-year Treasury note futures fell on Thursday, pulling away from a one-month high hit the previous day, as a rise in Chinese shares spurred selling of safe-haven Treasuries.
* Ten-year note futures fell 6/32 in price to 117-25/32 TYv1, off a one-month high of 118-14.5/32 hit the previous day.
, after state media said the country's stock regulator had approved several mutual funds this week in quiet support of the market, which has dropped about 20 percent over the past two weeks.
* Benchmark 10-year Treasuries slipped around 7/32 in price to yield 3.483 percent US10YT=RR, up 2 basis points from late U.S. trading the previous day. The 10-year yield hit a one-month low of 3.402 percent on Wednesday.
* Ten-year yields will probably hover in a range centred around 3.5 percent over the next month, said Yoshio Takahashi, a fixed income strategist for Barclays Capital.
* "It does not seem as if yields are poised to rise all that much," Takahashi said, adding that long-term Treasury yields are likely to stay stable at relatively low levels until personal consumption recovers smoothly and the outlook for the U.S. economy improves.
* Two-year notes dipped 1/32 in price to yield 1.012 percent US2YT=RR, rising about 2 basis points from late New York, and hovering above a one-month low of 0.972 percent hit the previous day.
* Japanese Ministry of Finance data (MOF) showed that Japanese investors bought a net 20.4 billion yen ($216.3 million) in foreign bonds last week, bringing their total buying in the first two weeks of August to 148.0 billion yen.
* A survey by Barclays Capital shows that there has been a shift in Japanese investors' expectations for U.S. long-term yields, Takahashi said. Since around late July, their expectations have been for such yields to rise, contrasting with their thinking back around May, when they were bracing for a drop, he said.
* Reuters calculations based on MOF's weekly capital flows data shows Japanese investors bought a net 1.9 trillion yen in foreign bonds in May. (Reporting by Masayuki Kitano; Editing by Joseph Radford)
