(Reuters) - Porsche SE axed its chief executive and said it will seek at least 5 billion euros in fresh funds, setting the stage for a merger of the German sportscar maker with mass-market rival Volkswagen.
- VW posted annual sales of almost 114 billion euros ($162 billion), more than 16 times Porsche's approximately 7 billion euros.*
- VW sold 6.27 million cars last year, more than 70 times the 87,000 cars delivered by Porsche.*
- VW has 370,000 staff globally vs 12,800 for Porsche
- VW's market value -- bloated by speculation that Porsche will buy more of its stock -- stands at more than 70 billion euros. Porsche's listed preferred shares are worth around 3.6 billion euros, but this excludes the unlisted voting shares held by the Porsche and Piech families.
- Porsche's stable of models is made up of the 911 sports coupe, the Boxster cabrio and its hard-top Cayman, the SUV Cayenne and the luxury sedan Panamera, with market launch slated for January 2010. It has plants in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen and Leipzig in Germany and uses an assembly plant in Finland.
- VW's brands comprise the namesake VW hallmark on passenger cars, vans and light trucks, Audi, Skoda, Seat, Bentley luxury cars, sports cars Lamborghini and Bugatti as well as Scania trucks. It has 61 plants in 21 countries including Germany, Spain, Brazil, China and Italy.
