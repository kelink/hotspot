(Reuters) - Scottish lawmakers on Wednesday backed a binding goal to cut greenhouse gases by 42 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels, edging Germany into second place in a ranking of the most ambitious developed world targets.
Scotland's bill included an option to curb its ambition if no strong global climate deal is reached in six months' time.
Environmental campaigners nevertheless hailed the decision by Scotland, which has ample potential for low-carbon wind power, having derided targets proposed earlier this month by Japan and Russia.
"At least one nation is prepared to aim for climate legislation that follows the science," said Kim Carstensen, head of the Global Climate Initiative of the WWF International environmental group.
China and many developing nations want the rich to cut carbon by at least 40 percent by 2020 to avoid the worst effects of global warming such as droughts, floods and rising seas.
The European Union has agreed a target to cut greenhouse gases by at least 20 percent by 2020, and Germany plans to cut carbon emissions by 40 percent compared with 1990 levels.
Green groups criticised Japan's and Russia's plans annnounced this month to cut emissions by 8 percent and 10-15 percent respectively [ID:nLM399610].
