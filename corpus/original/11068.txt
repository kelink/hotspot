On Aug. 19, it touched a low for the year of 2,761 points after a two-week market slump driven partly by worries over liquidity.
Chinese banks have only lent around 200 billion yuan ($29 billion) so far this month, with the biggest four state-owned banks lending around 100 billion yuan, bankers said.
If lending in August continues at such levels, it will lag far behind 360 billion yuan in July and a monthly average of more than 1 trillion yuan in the first six months of this year.
"The market had expected lending to fall in August but had not expected it to drop so sharply," said senior economist He Zhicheng at Agricultural Bank of China in Beijing.
"Such a drop will surely weigh on the stock market, with the index possibly testing the low (for this year) for a second time," he said.
