SNAP ANALYSIS: Suu Kyi verdict may set back U.S. policy rethink

(Reuters) - A court in Myanmar found opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi guilty on Tuesday of violating a security law, a ruling that could stall international efforts to coax the junta toward democratic reforms.
The ruling will trigger outrage around the world, criticism the military regime that has ruled the former Burma for almost five decades will most likely ignore.
* Western powers will immediately condemn the junta and demand the immediate release of Suu Kyi from house detention. However, the generals have repeatedly shown they are impervious to criticism and are unlikely to budge for anyone, not even the United Nations.
Nevertheless, by giving her the minimum sentence and then cutting it in half -- and allowing her to serve it at home -- the junta may have hoped to make itself look lenient in the eyes of the outside world.
* The detention will keep Suu Kyi out of circulation ahead of a general election scheduled for next year, in theory undermining any challenge from the opposition.
However, he previous marriage to a foreigner means she would not have been allowed to take part in the election anyway, and her detention could attract sympathy votes for her National League for Democracy party, whose landslide victory in 1990 polls was ignored by the junta.
* U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton extended an olive branch to the generals to boost ties with Myanmar, including investment, if it improved its human rights record and released Suu Kyi. The verdict could therefore prompt Washington to re-think its more reconciliatory approach.
* Threats of more sanctions on Myanmar could ensue, which would further isolate a country the international community has worked hard to engage. Critics says sanctions have failed because neighboring China, India and Thailand continue to do business with the generals.
* With diplomatic efforts exhausted, analysts say the United Nations could step up pressure on Myanmar by threatening a Security Council resolution, or legal action in the International Court of Justice over its poor human rights record.
* The junta will be on guard for a possible uprising among supporters of the hugely popular Suu Kyi, raising the possibility of a crackdown on protesters by a regime that has never been afraid to use brutal force on its own people.
