Gonzalez, the world number 12, secured the first set with a superb backhand but mixed sublime shots with a string of feckless errors as the German's aggressive tactics paid off.
Chilean Gonzalez, one of a handful of players competing for the last three spots at the season-ending World Tour Finals, will play Brazilian qualifier Thomaz Bellucci in the second round.
Blake lost an entertaining match against the world number two in Beijing last week and was under no misapprehensions about what he faces in the second round in China's financial capital.
"I know how difficult it is to play him," the New Yorker told reporters. "I know how much he makes you run, how hard he makes you work, how great defense he plays.
"I know what I'm in for, and I'll just prepare same way I did last week, just ... make sure my legs are fresh and ... be ready to face one of the best in the world."
Qualifier Lukasz Kubot spurned a chance to reacquaint himself with Andy Roddick, who he beat at the China Open last week.
