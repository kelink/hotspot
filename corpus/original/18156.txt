(Reuters) - China will draw on its vast foreign exchange reserves to support the global expansion of its banks and insurance firms, but only after it has first secured energy and resource supplies overseas, a top Chinese insurance executive said on Friday.
Yang Chao, chairman of China Life Insurance Co Ltd (
), the world's biggest life insurer by market value, said Beijing was already marshalling its $2 trillion in forex reserves to buy oil and iron ore.
"After securing our energy safety, the foreign exchange reserves will support financial firms expanding abroad," he said.
Yang said Chinese financial firms, including insurers, needed to quicken the pace of their global expansion to provide services to Chinese companies that were expanding overseas.
"It is a definite trend that Chinese insurers will expand in overseas markets and seek to develop globally," he said.
He said the yuan's evolution into a regional currency used beyond China's borders made the global expansion of Chinese financial firms all the more imperative.
Yang noted that the financial crisis had severely depressed the market values of companies around the world, creating many attractive acquisition possibilities.
"We must pay close attention and monitor the situation in order to grasp the opportunity," he said.
But he also noted that cross-border mergers and acquisitions were laden with risk and said China Life would be prudent while exploring opportunities. (Reporting by Langi Chiang and Simon Rabinovitch; Editing by Chris Lewis)
