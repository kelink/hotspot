(Reuters) - Japanese electronics group Toshiba Corp (
Cellphone sales in Japan tumbled about 30 percent last financial year as a new business model came into effect that led to handset price hikes, prompting consumers to hold onto their phones longer, while the economic downturn also weakened demand.
Toshiba's mobile phone unit sales halved last financial year, causing it to log its first annual operating loss on these operations in five years.
The company, Japan's No. 6 cellphone maker with a 7 percent market share, said it would continue to make smartphones in China on its own as it shifts focus to the growing segment of phones with computer capabilities.
The planned outsourcing would help it cut 4.5 billion yen ($47 million) in annual fixed costs, a Toshiba spokesman said.
Toshiba shares closed down 1.9 percent at 355 yen, against a 0.6 percent rise in the benchmark Nikkei average
