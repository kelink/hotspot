Q+A - Will the Indian rupee rally continue?
Fri  EDT
rose to its highest against the dollar in more than a year this week on strong and sustained capital inflows, arbitrage plays and an improving economic outlook.
At Thursday's high of 46.22, the partially convertible rupee was up nearly 13 percent from its record low of 52.2 in early March. It was trading at 46.58 per dollar on Friday.
WHAT IS DRIVING THE RALLY?
A surging stock market -- it is up about 75 percent in 2009 -- has seen companies raise more than $15 billion in share sales, most of it in recent months, and more sales are scheduled.
Foreigners have bought a net $12.7 billion of stocks so far this year, including about $4 billion in September, almost reversing net outflows of more than $13 billion in 2008.
With markets looking for interest rates to rise in India from the first quarter of 2010, inflows from traders looking to profit on interest rate differentials are expected to pick up.

The dollar's broad weakness has also played a part, including fuelling an arbitrage play with offshore non-deliverable forward (NDF) rupee contracts. The dollar has fallen further against the rupee in NDFs than in the local market, where its harder for speculators to trade.
As a results, banks have been buying dollars in the NDF market and selling them in the Indian spot market, where they fetched a higher price.
One-month NDFs showed the rupee quoted at 46.51 per dollar, which shows the rupee about 0.15 rupees stronger offshore than onshore for than tenor.
CAN IT GO ON?
HDFC Bank expects the rupee to rise to as much as 45-46 per dollar by end-December compared with Friday's level of 46.58.

Analysts expect flows via external sources like offshore borrowings, debt inflows along with portfolio investments to continue in 2009 and into early 2010, helping the rupee rise.
One-year non-deliverable forwards PNDF are pricing in a 1.3 percent slide in the rupee from current levels, compared to a 2 percent decline at end-July, reflecting the changing sentiment.
Technically, the rupee has finally broken above a 38.2 percent retracement point after struggling against resistance at that level in May, June and August. The retracement level was based on its fall from a decade high of 39.2 per dollar in late 2007 to a record low of 52.2 in March.
WHAT IS THE RBI'S POSITION?
The RBI has a history of intervention. In 2007, it intervened to curtail a rise in the rupee and in 2008 and 2009 it intervened to stem losses. It says it acts to curb volatility rather than target a level.
Dealers and analysts expect the central bank to intervene if the rupee rises to 46 per dollar, though any intervention would be modest because the RBI would be aware that many Asian currencies are rising in the face of broad dollar weakness.
That dollar weakness should also limit the rupee's trade-weighted gains. JP Morgan estimates the rupee is overvalued by more than 6 percent, above what it thought would be the central bank's preferred threshhold level of 5 percent.
The inflows wouldn't be soaked up by federal borrowing because most of its annual programme has been completed and much of any remaining issuance will be funded out of the central bank's intervention fund.
However, sterilising any intervention, by issuing debt to soak up the inflows and keep them out of money supply, carried costs to the government, at a time when finances are under already strained. To see the speech:
