(Reuters) - Chinese authorities are holding over 50 Mexicans in hotels and other sites, fearing the spread of the H1N1 flu, an official at the Mexican embassy in Beijing said on Sunday, adding only one of them had symptoms of the flu.
Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa on Saturday criticised China, saying "Mexican citizens showing no signs at all of being ill, have been isolated, under unacceptable conditions."
Mexico's ambassador to Beijing, Jorge Guajardo, went to a hotel in the capital where over 10 Mexicans have been held, but was not allowed to see to them, said the embassy official. She spoke on condition of anonymity.
The confined Mexicans -- mostly business people and tourists, many in transit to other countries -- are being held in several parts of China, including Hong Kong, said the embassy official.
Around 35 are in Shanghai, six in the far southern city of Guangzhou, and six in Hong Kong, she said.
"All of them have no symptoms," said the official, adding that the exception was a Mexican man under quarantine in Hong Kong who was found to have the virus.
"These are discriminatory measures, without foundation...The Foreign Ministry recommends avoiding travelling to China until these measures are corrected," Mexican Foreign Minister Espinosa said on Saturday.
Espinosa also condemned China, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador and Cuba for suspending flights from Mexico due to the flu outbreak. Mexico traditionally has had good ties with all of those nations.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry had no immediate response to Espinosa's criticism or to the Embassy's claims.
Many of the confined Mexicans were on the same flight to Shanghai, but others had reached China on flights from Los Angeles, Newark and Vancouver, said the embassy official.
