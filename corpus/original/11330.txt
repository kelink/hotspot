South Korea gives rocket launch a second shot

(Reuters) - South Korea will try again on Tuesday to launch its first space rocket, a move that will be watched warily by reclusive North Korea, after halting last week's countdown minutes before lift-off.
South Korea's space agency said the August 19 launch was aborted because of a glitch with pressure gauge software.
Fuel was removed from the rocket after the halt, requiring several days to reschedule.
The development of the rocket, the Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1, or Naro-1, depended heavily on Russia's Khrunichev space production center, which built the first stage booster, conducted tests and provided technical assistance.
The launch is expected to rile prickly North Korea, which was hit by U.N. sanctions after its fired off a long-range rocket in April in what was widely seen as a disguised missile test. North Korea, which chastised the world body for the punishment, said earlier this month it was paying close attention to the South's rocket program.
But its nascent space program lags far behind Japan, China, India, and to some extent North Korea. Seoul is betting that a successful launch will give it the technical prowess to catch up quickly with its rivals.
South Korea's space agency has tried to play down expectations, saying that only about 30 percent of countries' first attempts to put a satellite into orbit succeed.
