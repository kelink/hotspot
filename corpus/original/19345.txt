(Reuters) - Gold dropped more than 2 percent Tuesday on the back of sharply lower platinum prices amid demand worries and technical selling, tempting bullion investors to lock in profits.
Other precious metals also fell, with platinum and palladium both down more than 5 percent at their session lows on worries about an uncertain future of U.S. automakers, and silver was off more than 4 percent.
Spot gold traded at $893.60 an ounce at 3:08 p.m. EDT (1908 GMT), down 1.5 percent from its late Monday quote of $906.75 an ounce in New York.

"In the last two days, we are down $30, and that is too much for you not to have to react if you are a technical trader and long," he said.
The boost provided by news that China has hiked its gold reserves by three-quarters since 2003 has largely petered out, traders said. Nout Wellink, a member of the governing council of the European Central Bank, said China's move to diversify reserves was positive, but unsurprising.
He also said the bank planned to renew the Central Bank Gold Agreement, which restricts signatories' gold sales to 500 tonnes a year, when it expires in September.
Gold and gold receivables held by euro zone central banks fell sharply in the week to April 24, down 823 million euros, the ECB said separately.
On the wider markets, platinum group metals followed equities to trade lower as concerns grew over the potential economic impact of the swine flu outbreak, though U.S. shares managed to recover opening losses as economic data cheered traders. .N
