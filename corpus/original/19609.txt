(Reuters) - China Construction Bank (
), the world's second-biggest lender by value, on Friday posted an 18.3 percent fall in first quarter earnings, hit in part by provisions set aside earlier in the year.
The government-controlled bank said first-quarter net profit fell to 26.3 billion yuan ($3.85 billion), from a net profit of 32.1 billion yuan in the year-earlier period.
CCB was expected to report a fall of about 18 percent, the average forecast of analysts at Macquarie and UBS showed.
Its net interest income, mainly driven by lending, reached 50.9 billion yuan in the first quarter, down 6.6 percent, while fee and commission income was 11.8 billion yuan, up 10.4 percent.
Net interest margins fell to 2.58 percent at end-March as the average yield of interest-earning assets decreased, hurt by consecutive cuts in interest rates by the central bank and ample market liquidity.
The bank said the carrying amount of U.S. sub-prime mortgage loan-backed securities held by the group was US$136 million, for which allowances for impairment losses of US$733 million had been made.
Earlier on Friday, Pang Xiusheng, CCB's chief financial officer, told Reuters on the sidelines of a Beijing forum that first quarter net profit would be down more than 10 percent.
The CFO also said that he expected full year 2009 earnings to exceed analysts' forecasts.
Macquarie said in a research report this week that it expected CCB's net profit to be 26.1 billion yuan. CCB's loan growth was expected to grow, though Macquarie did not expect to see significant improvement in the bank's credit quality.
CCB's Hong Kong-listed shares rose 4 cents to HK$4.42 on Friday. The shares have risen 3.3 percent so far this year through Thursday, trailing a 5.7 percent gain on the benchmark Hang Seng Index
Construction Bank said its non-performing loan (NPL) ratio fell to 1.9 percent at the end of March. Net loan and advances to customers rose 14.1 percent in the quarter to 4.2 trillion yuan, while deposits from customers rose 13.2 percent from the end of last year to 7.2 trillion yuan.
The bank's capital adequacy ratio reached 12.37 percent at end-March, a 0.21 percentage point increase from end-2008.
In January, BoA raised $2.83 billion by selling part of its CCB stake, as the struggling U.S. bank faced mounting pressures at home. BoA was given a $25 billion infusion as part of the U.S. government's banking industry bailout last year. ($1=6.826 Yuan) (US$1=HK$7.8) (Reporting by Jacqueline Wong; Editing by David Cowell)
