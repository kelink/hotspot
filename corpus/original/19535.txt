(Reuters) - Asia, a continent that has battled deadly viruses such as the H5N1 bird flu and SARS in recent years, began taking steps over the weekend to ward off a new flu virus.
The swine flu virus has killed up to 81 people in Mexico and infected 11 others in the United States. More than 1,300 are believed to be infected in Mexico.
Analysts did not think the epidemic would have a dramatic impact on markets on Monday morning, but warned that if the epidemic worsens that could change.
"It's still too early to say how far and wide this may spread but investors will be cautious," said Ben Kwong, chief operating officer with KGI Asia.
Patrick Shum, strategist at Karl Thomson Securities, agreed that investors would be keeping a close eye on developments in the coming days.
"There won't be an immediate significant impact on the market but if it is anything like SARS, especially coming at a time when most global economies are in a recession, then markets will take a hit," he said.
China's quarantine authority an issued emergency notice on Saturday night requiring people to report flu-like symptoms at ports of entry when coming from swine flu-affected places. The ministries of health and agriculture say they are closely monitoring the situation.
Singapore's ministry of health says it is monitoring the situation closely and has urged medical staff to be on the alert for any suspect human cases.
It advised the public to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms of swine flu within seven days of travel to California, Texas or Mexico. It urged them to maintain good hygiene and wash hands frequently, especially after contact with respiratory secretions. Those who are sick with respiratory illnesses should avoid crowded areas and wear masks.
Nguyen Huy Nga, head of the health ministry's Preventive Medicine Department, was quoted by the state-run Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper on Sunday saying that the country needed to watch developments closely as the virus may be spreading in U.S. states where many people of Vietnamese origin are living.
The government has stepped up quarantine and safety checks on travellers arriving from the United States and Mexico, as well as pork imports from these countries.
An emergency quarantine system is now up and running, with simple tests conducted on people arriving with flu symptoms at airports.
"People who develop respiratory illness within seven days after returning from the affected places should put on a surgical mask and seek medical consultation from public clinics and hospitals immediately," said Thomas Tsang said, controller of the Centre for Health Protection.
Japan's Narita airport, east of Tokyo, ramped up temperature checks for travellers from Mexico using thermographic imaging equipment, which was previously in place at the airport.
Japan's foreign ministry issued an advisory asking those who were going to Mexico to consider if such trips were necessary.
Japan's Kyodo news agency reported that Japan's farm ministry had instructed animal quarantine officers to examine imported live pigs to make sure they were not infected.
The ministry did not ask for checks on imported pork as it says cooking kills the virus. It regarded the possibility of the virus turning up in pork to be low, Kyodo reported.
Malaysia's health ministry has begun screening passengers travelling to and from Mexico at all border points.
