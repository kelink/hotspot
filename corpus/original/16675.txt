) said it was in talks with potential local partners in China to jointly make LCD panels there, taking aim at growing flat TV demand in the world's third-largest economy.
Such a move would mark a departure from Sharp's usual strategy of making core products at home.
"It is true that we are considering building a plant (to make LCDs) in China," Sharp President Mikio Katayama told reporters.

The factory, located in the western Japan city of Sakai, will be the world's first plant that handles so-called 10th-generation glass substrates, which are bigger than earlier-generation substrates and help reduce per-panel production costs.
Sharp is the world's fourth-largest LCD TV maker after Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (
), Sony Corp (
The maker of Aquos brand LCD TVs held a 9 percent share in the global market in January-March, according to research company DisplaySearch.
Prior to Katayama's comments, shares in Sharp closed up 1.1 percent at 1,097 yen, compared with a 1 percent gain in the Nikkei average
