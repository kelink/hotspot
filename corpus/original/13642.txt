(Reuters) - China's Guo Jinjing said she would try to compete at the London 2012 Olympics after sealing her fifth straight three-meter springboard gold at the world championships on Tuesday.
But compatriot Qiu Bo failed to fully re-establish China's superiority after a wobbly start to the championships when he lost out to British 15-year-old Tom Daley in the men's 10m platform final.
Guo, who has scooped more Olympic golds than any other female diver, led throughout the final and racked up an overall score of 388.20 from her five dives in the blistering heat.
"It is still hard to say whether I will compete at the London 2012 Olympic Games. I will try. As for the 2011 world championships in Shanghai, I don't know either," the 27-year-old told reporters.
"I performed well, I'm quite satisfied. However, there are still many things I could improve."
One of China's best known sports personalities, the "Diving Princess" had been expected to retire after last year's Beijing Olympics.
She has also won gold in the 3m synchronized event in the last four world championships and is poised to target another one in Friday's final at Rome's Foro Italico.
Canada's Emilie Heymans snatched silver in the individual competition while third-placed Italian Tania Cagnotto gave the host nation its first medal of the world aquatics championships to the delight of a success-starved crowd.
The Chinese media had begun to talk of a 'crisis' in their diving team after relinquishing two titles over the weekend and although Guo is still all-conquering, Qiu's failure on his final dive handed the title to Daley.
The Briton, his country's youngest competitor at the Beijing Games, seized gold after receiving eight 10s from the judges across his last two dives.
China's Zhou Luxin took bronze.
