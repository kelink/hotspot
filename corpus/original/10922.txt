(Reuters) - China's benchmark stock index opened down 1.5 percent on Monday, heading for its biggest monthly loss in 10 months, after surging stock valuations overwhelmed improvements in corporate earnings and new share supplies compounded a drop in liquidity as bank lending fell.
opened at 2,817.629 points, putting it on track to post a 17.4 percent loss for the month after recording seven consecutive monthly gains.
The index sank 2.9 percent on Friday amid worries about a steep drop in Chinese bank lending in August, which would trim liquidity flowing into stocks.
But analysts said slowing lending should have no major impact on the economy, partly because Chinese companies are turning a large share of the short-term discounted bill financing they received in the first half of this year into long-term investment in the second half.
State media reported on Monday that the combined net profit of China's 1,600-plus listed companies grew 36 percent in the second quarter of this year from the first quarter, a good omen for corporate earnings for all 2009.
