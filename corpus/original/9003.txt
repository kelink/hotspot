(Reuters) - French nickel and manganese group Eramet (
) raised its forecast for second-half operating profit to around breakeven level, as it posted a 40 percent drop in third-quarter sales.
The company, the world's sixth-largest nickel producer, had previously guided for a second-half current operating loss after a 223 million euro ($331.9 million) loss in its first half.
Eramet said nickel and manganese markets improved during the third quarter, boosted by stimulus plans and stock adjustments, but the prospect for economic recovery remained uncertain outside China.
The group would continue to adjust its production of nickel and manganese in response to market conditions, it said.
Eramet has been hit by a drop in metal prices and demand since a global downturn began in late 2008, and it reiterated targets to cut costs by 140 million euros this year and reduce industrial investment to 336 million euros.
"A certain improvement was seen in the third quarter of 2009 on nickel and manganese markets, compared with the very low levels reached in the first half of the year," Eramet's Chairman and Chief Executive Patrick Buffet said in a statement.
Eramet's third-quarter sales reached 637 million euros, down 40 percent on the year, but up slightly on the prior quarter.
Manganese sales were 324 million euros, down 50 percent against a year-earlier period marked by high prices, but up 17 percent quarter-on-quarter due to a sharp increase in deliveries of manganese ore and alloys, Eramet said.
To reflect increased demand, Eramet raised its manganese ore output during the quarter to two-thirds of capacity, up from one-third in the first half of the year.
Sales at the nickel branch came to 155 million euros, down 7 percent year-on-year and flat versus the previous quarter.
Demand for nickel improved during the second and third quarters in view of a pick-up in stainless steel production from very low levels at the start of the year, Eramet said.
The group's nickel output reached 38,700 tonnes in the first nine months of the year, representing about 80 percent of capacity and in line with Eramet's target for 2009.
The company said previously it planned to trim production of nickel in the French overseas territory of New Caledonia to 50,000 tonnes this year, down from 51,000 in 2008.
Eramet's alloys branch posted sales of 157 million euros, down 36 percent on the year and 21 percent on the previous quarter, with steel tools and aeronautics particularly affected. ($1=.6718 Euro) (Reporting by Gus Trompiz)
