(Reuters) - Greece's Piraeus Port (OLP), one of the largest in the Mediterranean, said on Thursday it crossed into profit in the first half after cargo traffic increased.
"Turnover rose due to an increase in cargo business, which led to a 102.17 percent rise in revenues," the company said in a statement.
Revenues from the car terminal fell more than 50 percent in the first half of 2009 as the global economic downturn hit car imports, OLP said.
China's Cosco Pacific (
), the world's fifth-largest port operator, last year signed a 3.4 billion euro deal with OLP to run cargo facilities at Piraeus for 35 years, starting from October 2009.
OLP, which is 74 percent state-owned, has seen its shares gaining about 56 percent since the start of the year, outperforming a 42 percent rise in the Athens' general stock index
