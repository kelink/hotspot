(Reuters) - The dollar rose on Wednesday as news China would restrict redundant investment underscored concern about a global recovery and tempered the positive impact of data showing a jump in new U.S. home sales.

U.S. durable goods orders also rose in July, but a key measure of business demand -- non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft -- fell, reminding investors the economy still faces huge challenges. [ID:nN26259327]
"The new home sales data was good, there's no doubt about it. The question is, are signs that the U.S. economy is starting to bottom good for the U.S. dollar or for other currencies," said David Watt, senior strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto.

Andrew Wilkinson, market strategist at Interactive Brokers in Greenwich, Connecticut, argued that dollar weakness may be a "longer-run certainty," but it does not seem to fit in the current environment when a global recovery remains shaky.
"We would not be surprised to see more investors throw in the towel on the euro in favor of a dollar that may yet push back below $1.40 before August is through," he added.
