(Reuters) - Giant Mexican media company Televisa is exploring a new venture in Spain and will soon launch a regional sports channel as part of its fast-growing pay television business, a senior executive said on Friday.
Alfonso de Angoitia, Televisa's (
) executive vice president, told analysts during a conference call that the company is also planning to produce a widely popular soap opera in Brazil.
In Spain, where Televisa (
) holds a stake in television company La Sexta, the Mexican company has not ruled out La Sexta joining forces with top media conglomerate Grupo Prisa, he said.
"Imagina, our partner in La Sexta, is in negotiations with Grupo Prisa ... for a potential combination of La Sexta with Prisa's Channel Four (Cuatro)," De Angoitia said. He added that an agreement could be reached in the second half of 2009.
Televisa is the world's leading Spanish-language content producer and its name is synonymous with tear-jerking soap operas popular among Russian and Argentine audiences alike.
Jose Baston, president of television and content, told analysts that Televisa's new cable sports-only network is due to launch in August, as it continues to strengthen its presence in the pay television market.
The new business is expected to break even in 2011 and the signal will be available in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.
Televisa posted a 0.7 percent decline in second-quarter net profit on Thursday, below results forecast in a Reuters poll, due to higher financing costs and losses at some of its affiliates.
The company's Sky direct-to-home business is feeling pinched by increasing competition from Dish Mexico, as shown by weaker quarterly customer base growth. Dish debuted in the Mexican market late in 2008 and has already gathered half a million clients, compared with Sky's nearly 1.8 million.
