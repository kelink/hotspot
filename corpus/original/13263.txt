The group, owned by the ruler of Dubai, missed its original target to open the 338-room Jumeirah Han Tang Xintandi Hotel in Shanghai, China's financial hub, in late 2008 and in January pushed it back to later this year.
The group has 14 hotels under construction from Shanghai to Phuket, Thailand and the Maldives, and looks to hit a target of 60 hotels under management by 2012.
Jumeirah also has management agreements in Argentina, U.S. Virgin Islands and Costa Rica. (Reporting by Jason Benham; editing by Simon Jessop)
