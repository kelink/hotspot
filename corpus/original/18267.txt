UPDATE 2-Arkema swings to Q1 loss, challenges remain

(Reuters) - French specialty chemicals maker Arkema (
) swung to a net loss in the first quarter, suffering like its peers from a slump in demand, and said the economic context would remain "highly challenging" this year.
"2009 will remain a very difficult year. That will be the basis of our working plan," Chief Executive Thierry Le Henaff said on a conference call, adding that apart from a pick-up in demand in China, "we don't see any tangible improvement".
Arkema's net loss was 35 million euros compared with a profit of 72 million a year earlier. But core earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell 64 percent to 57 million euros on sales that were down more than 25 percent at 1.09 billion euros.
EBITDA beat market consensus, some analysts said, pushing Arkema shares up as high as 7 percent. They rose 6.4 percent to 18.38 euros by 0804 GMT, giving a market value of 1.1 billion euros. The DJ Stoxx chemical index .SX4P fell 0.5 percent.
"They've shown an encouraging performance compared to their specialty peers and very robust cash flow generation," Societe Generale analyst Peter Clark said, rating Arkema shares "hold" with a share price target of 18 euros.
As at the end of 2008, clients, mostly in the building and car sectors, were pruning purchases and using up stock, leading to a 27 percent drop in volumes.
On top of that, Arkema cut prices by 1.3 percent due to lower prices in polyvinyl chloride (PVC), used in window profiles and vinyl floors, and acrylics, which are used in plastics and paper.
Its Industrial Products unit, which makes products ranging from fluorochemicals that are used in refrigeration to thiochemicals for water treatment, has resisted the effects of the financial crisis relatively well with an improved EBITDA margin of 14.3 percent from 13.9 percent of sales in the year before period.
Volumes have been improving in China in recent weeks, but unlike French rival Rhodia RHA.PA and Switzerland's Clariant (
), which said they saw signs of improvement in the coming quarters, [ID:nL6500959] Arkema did not give a forecast.
China accounts for about 6 percent of Arkema's total sales.
Le Henaff said in an interview with Reuters at the end of last month that Arkema was betting on research and development, and the launch of high value-added products to take it through the global financial crisis. [ID:nLS467647]
Meanwhile, production capacities would continue to be adapted, which would enhance productivity in the coming weeks and months, Arkema said.
It announced plans on Tuesday to cut 200 jobs at its North American subsidiary and said it expected the restructuring measure to yield cost savings of 30 million euros in 2010 and total annual savings of 37 million by 2012.
