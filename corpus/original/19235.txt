Gold hovers below $900 on stock market gains

(Reuters) - Gold fell toward $890 per ounce on Thursday, coming under pressure from extended gains in equities markets, but a fall in the dollar versus the euro limited losses.
World stocks struck a four-month peak on Thursday, powered by gains in Asia, as investors took heart from a record drop in U.S. business inventories and surprisingly robust consumer spending.
Activity though was limited before many Asian markets close on Friday for a public holiday, while Japanese markets are closed for national holidays on May 4-6.
"Gold keeps hovering slightly below $900 although the market has found that there is no strong buying interest at or below $890. But so far, neither large-lot selling nor buying has been detected," said Kaname Gokon, deputy general manager at Okato Shoji Co's research section.
Spot gold was at $894.45 per ounce at 11:24 p.m. EDT, down 0.2 percent from New York's notional close of $897.60.
U.S. gold futures for June delivery were at $896.3 per ounce, down 0.5 percent from Wednesday's settlement at $900.50.
Gold bullion hit a four-week high of $918.25 on Monday as equities markets fell, due partly to fears a swine flu outbreak could hurt the economy, and on hopes China would continue to buy gold to increase reserves.
Profit-taking has since capped the precious metal, but a reversal in the dollar's jump on safe-haven buying earlier this week is providing support, traders said.
The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.3320 on Thursday, extending gains made the previous day after the Federal Reserve made no changes to its monetary policy but offered a less bleak outlook on the U.S. economy.
Chart-driven activity could increase price volatility, in particular when volume is low, some traders said.
Okato Shoji's Gokon said stop-loss selling could be triggered if spot gold falls to or below $885, while stop-loss buying could push it higher if it rises to or above $905.
The world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, the SPDR Gold Trust, said holdings stayed at 1,104.45 metric tons as of April 29, unchanged since April 23.
