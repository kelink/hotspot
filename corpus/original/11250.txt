METALS-Copper settles lower as demand worries mount

(Reuters) - Copper prices settled lower on Tuesday as investors booked profits and took to the sidelines amid worries about over-heated price levels and slowing Chinese demand.
Copper for December delivery HGZ9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division fell 5.70 cents, or 1.9 percent, to settle at $2.8735 a lb, near the bottom of the session range between $2.8635 and $2.9150.
On the London Metal Exchange (LME), three-month copper MCU3 shed $107 to close at $6,311 a tonne. In after-hours trade, the metal used in power and construction fell further, hitting a low of $6,250 a tonne.
"Copper is just wobbling a bit," said Nick Moore, global head of commodity strategy at RBS Global Banking and Markets. "It is a bit of a pause for thought and reflection."
Prices of the red metal have more than doubled this year amid a combination of Chinese stockpiling, investment fund buying and improving economic sentiment.
China, worried about its $2 trillion pile of foreign currency, has been looking at ways to hedge its exposure to the dollar, including using the money to buy inflation-resistant physical assets.
But data showing China's refined copper imports fell by 23 percent in July indicated slowing demand in the world's top copper consumer. Analysts said tightening Chinese monetary policy may pressure prices in the near term. [ID:nHKG332312]
"The market is concerned about the potential slowing of China," added Moore.
Michael Pento, chief economist with Delta Global Advisors, cited a sharp contraction in the U.S. monetary base as another cause for concern going ahead for the broader commodities complex.
"If you look at the money supply, which is the most paramount metric to look at when you're looking at prices in dollars for some of these commodities, you'll see that it has completely stalled out ... there is no more money coming through and I think we are going to see base metals, precious metals and energies correct after some huge advances," he said.
Also highlighting weak demand, copper stocks rose 3,875 tonnes to 296,600 tonnes -- the highest since early June.

"For the time being there is a bit more hesitation in the market (with) some people standing aside and this withdrawal of liquidity is having an impact on markets," said Michael Khosrowpour, an analyst at Triland Metals.
Aluminum MAL3 closed at $1,900 a tonne from $1,927. LME stocks for the metal, used in transport and packaging, slipped 3,575 tonnes, but held near record levels above 4.6 million tonnes.
Steel-making ingredient nickel MNI3 closed at $19,355 from $19,600 on Monday and battery material lead MPB3 closed at $2,061 from $2,025 a tonne.
Investors were keeping a close eye on developments in Asia, where Hunan, the second-biggest producer of refined lead among China's provinces, is checking lead smelters in the wake of lead poisoning in Shaanxi province. [ID:nSP447110]
Earlier lead rose to $2,068, the highest since late September last year. Analysts warned there could be more lead closures in China, as officials clamp down on polluting smelters in the region.
Zinc MZN3 edged lower to close at $1,852 a tonne from $1,856 and tin MSN3 was untraded at the close but was last bid at $13,990 from $14,375.
