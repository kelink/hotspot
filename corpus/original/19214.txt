(Reuters) - Domestic sales of Mexican pork have dropped by as much as 85 percent on fears of a deadly swine flu epidemic, Enrique Dominguez, head of the pork producers association, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.
Dominguez said there was no evidence the virus, which has killed up to 159 people in Mexico, is related to pork products since it does not affect pigs and is passed from human to human, but said misinformation was scaring consumers.
"National sales were practically nothing (this week)," Dominguez said. "We don't have the capacity to maintain the animals in the farms or the capacity to warehouse the meat," he said.
Mexico produces about 100,000 tonnes of pork a month but only enough space to warehouse about 5,000 tonnes, he said.
Some countries were quick to ban U.S. pork after reports that Americans had contracted a new swine flu strain, even as health experts and government officials decried the action as unsubstantiated. [ID:nN29397190]
Mexico imports about 600,000 tonnes of pork a year, largely from the United States. It imports far more than it exports.
The bulk of Mexico's 68,000 tonnes of annual pork exports go to Japan, which has not restricted imports, and South Korea where officials have banned the import of live pigs but not pork meat. (Reporting by Mica Rosenberg; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)
