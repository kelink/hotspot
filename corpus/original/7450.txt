(Reuters) - China Shipbuilding Industry Co, the country's biggest ship equipment producer, said on Wednesday it would launch an initial public stock offering as it needed 6.4 billion yuan ($937 million) to expand production capacity.
China Shipbuilding plans to issue up to 2 billion A shares denominated in yuan, or up to 30 percent of its expanded share capital after the IPO, for a listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, it said in a prospectus published in the official Shanghai Securities News.
China International Capital Corp (CICC) has been appointed the IPO's lead underwriter, China Shipbuilding said.

Sky-high urban property prices also rose another 3.9 percent in October from a year earlier, prompting officials and economists to issue stern warnings about possible asset bubbles.
China Shipbuilding will start consultations on pricing the offer on Thursday and take institutional subscriptions on December 4 and retail subscriptions on December 7, its prospectus said.
China Shipbuilding said it hoped to list on the Shanghai bourse as soon as possible after the IPO, but the prospectus did not give a firm date.
