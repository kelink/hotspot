) posted lower first-half results as consumers deferred discretionary spending, but said it remained comfortable with the full-year market view as sales trends improved.
The company, which makes the Zoffany, Sanderson, and Harlequin brands, said shortfall in brand revenues against the same period last year had been gradually declining each month since the end of March.
"Our mid-market brands Harlequin, Sanderson and Morris & Co are performing more strongly than our upper-end brands," Chief Executive John Sach told Reuters, adding, "Their sales decline on previous periods is almost halted."
However, he expected the upmarket Zoffany brand to continue to struggle. "We think that top-end of the market is extraordinarily difficult at the moment," Sach said.
Harlequin gets about 19 million pounds of annual turnover, while Sanderson and Zoffany account for about 13 million pounds. and 9 million pounds respectively.
Sach said he expected the company's market share to rise to about 20 percent from 15 percent in the mid-upper end of UK's wallcoverings and furnishing fabrics industry in over two to three years.
"There's an awful lot of small players in the market place and they are probably not going to survive the recession," Sach said.
"And you know to gain market share is not just about products and product design, it's (also) about distribution and with our Harlequin and Sanderson brands we have extremely wide distribution," he said.
The company, which gets slightly over 40 percent of its turnover from the UK market, expects to grow its business in the United States and emerging markets like China through organic growth, Sach said.
Pretax profit was 0.57 million pounds ($905,700) for the six months ended July 31, compared with 1.72 million pounds in the year-ago period.
The company, which undertook a range of cost-saving measures recently, incurred redundancy expenses of 246,000 pounds and a pension charge of 300,000 pounds.
The company said the largest market for its brands -- the UK -- saw an 8 percent revenue decline, while the United States and Europe were down 31 percent and 20 percent, respectively, in local currency.
Shares of the company, which competes with Colefax Group Plc (
), rose 6.58 percent to 20.25 pence by 1205 GMT on Wednesday on the London Stock Exchange. They have gained 62 percent in the last six months. ($1=.6293 Pound) (Reporting by Purwa Naveen Raman in Bangalore; Editing by Vinu Pilakkott and Aradhana Aravindan)
