(Reuters) - China's Ping An Insurance (Group) (
) said on Friday it would buy out Newbridge Capital's stake in mid-sized lender Shenzhen Development Bank (
Ping An, the world's second-largest insurer by market value and keen to build itself into a financial conglomerate, will also pay up to 10.7 billion yuan for up to 585 million shares in Shenzhen Bank in a private share placement, leaving it with a stake of as much as 30 percent.
Both companies are based in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, near Hong Kong.
The transaction for the 16.76 percent stake held by Newbridge, a unit of TPG Capital [TPG.UL], can be in cash or a swap of 299,088,758 of Ping An's Hong Kong-listed H shares, which closed at HK$59.05 last Friday before a trading suspension pending an announcement.
The deal must be completed by Dec. 31, 2010, and is still subject to approval by Chinese regulators.
In a statement to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, Shenzhen Bank said it would sell between 370 million and 585 million shares to Ping An for 18.26 yuan apiece in the private placement portion of the deal.
The bank's shares closed at 20 yuan last Friday, before they were suspended.
Shenzhen Bank has been seeking new funding to bolster its capital and meet regulatory requirements. Its capital adequacy ratio stood at 8.53 percent at end-March, below the 10 percent requirement for listed mid-sized lenders.
Ping An, hit by a 22.79 billion yuan impairment loss last year on its investment in Dutch-Belgian financial group Fortis FOR.AS, has said it will take a cautious stance on foreign investments, but maintains an ambitious aim of building a financial supermarket at home, with banking, asset management and insurance as its three pillars of business.
Richard Jackson, head of Ping An's banking unit, told Reuters in March that Ping An Bank would consider acquisitions to boost its distribution network and scale. Ping An lost a bid for control of Guangdong Development Bank to Citigroup (
