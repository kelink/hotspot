Global factory PMI dips in Sept but still expanding

(Reuters) - Global factory business activity held broadly steady in September after expanding for the first time in over a year during August, while production and new orders growth slipped a bit, a survey showed on Thursday.
The global index, produced by JP Morgan with research and supply management organisations, dipped to a 53.0 in September from 53.1 in August.
This marks the second consecutive month the index has been above the 50.0 mark that divides growth from contraction, after breaking even in July having spent 13 months in contractionary territory.
"The global PMI stalled in September after many months of gains. Current levels of output and orders are extremely elevated, consistent with robust growth in current and near-term manufacturing activity," said David Hensley, a director at JP Morgan.
JP Morgan said that over the last quarter as a whole, the average reading was the highest since the last three months of 2007.
Input prices continued to rise, at an unchanged rate from August, as increased prices in the U.S., China and India were offset by falling prices in the euro zone, Japan and the UK.
Earlier data showed the euro zone's manufacturing sector contracted less sharply than first thought, although the recovery momentum slowed, while in the United States the sector expanded for a second consecutive month, albeit at a weaker-than-expected rate.
China's manufacturing sector continued to gather strength last month and India also saw factory output rise. However, activity in Britain shrank unexpectedly.
The index combines survey data from countries including the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia. (Reporting by Jonathan Cable; Editing by Toby Chopra)
