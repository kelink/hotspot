U.S. considers auto parts action against China

(Reuters) - The United States is considering action against auto parts imports from China and closely examining other concerns about automobile trade with the world's second largest economy, a top U.S. trade official said on Friday.
"We are looking at a variety of issues in the bilateral relationship, including, I would say, in the auto sector," Tim Reif, general counsel in the U.S. Trade Representative's office, told reporters.
Early this year as the U.S. presidential election approached, the United Steelworkers union and related groups began pressing President Barack Obama to take steps to stop what they described as a flood of auto parts imports from China.
That was followed by a letter from 188 members of Congress, included many from Midwest industrial states like Ohio and Michigan, which are expected to be important in Obama's bid to win re-election in November.
"As we look at these matters, we can not talk a lot about them," Reif said when asked about the status of the request. "But we are certainly looking at that. We are looking at matters that involve automobiles as well."
Reif insisted the timing of any action on the automotive front against China would be based on a "careful examination of the facts," and not a desire to win votes for Obama.
"As you know these cases involve easily months, oftentimes years of preparation. So when you see us file a request for consultations (at the WTO), that is not something we ginned up in the last week or two, or month or two," Reif said.
