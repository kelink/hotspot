China to expand investment options for yuan

(Reuters) - China pushed for greater international use of the yuan on Wednesday by promising to let foreign investors buy mainland shares and bonds, pushing up shares of brokerage stocks listed in Hong Kong.
The plans, among a string of others unveiled by China Vice Premier Li Keqiang, underscored Beijing's intent to propel explosive growth in the Hong Kong offshore yuan market and turn the yuan, or renminbi, into a widely-traded currency one day.
In a sign of Beijing's patent currency ambitions, it also concluded the biggest-ever offshore yuan bond deal on Wednesday in Hong Kong, which Li made clear would remain the paramount center for cultivating a yuan market outside China.
"Hong Kong can make good use of the opportunities in the yuan's growing importance...to further enhance its status as an international financial center," Li said at a launch of the record-sized yuan bond that was attended by other Chinese officials including Central Bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan.
Li's speech, with its specific policy announcements, along with other recent substantive speeches from him appeared to signal that China's top leaders are preparing him for a larger role ahead of his widely expected promotion to premier in 2013.
By letting more yuan flow between China and Hong Kong, analysts said China gets room to experiment with a gradual easing in capital controls that may be shaken off in a big way overtime if Beijing chooses to free the yuan.
For investors in the Hong Kong offshore yuan market who can only funnel their yuan into yuan deposits or yuan-denominated bonds for vapid returns of between 0.4-3 percent, analysts say the scheme, also known as "R QFII," gives respite.
"With more investment options available, firms and depositors in Hong Kong will use and hold yuan more willingly in the future, which is a positive move," said Chen Yong, an analyst at Huatai United Securities in Shanghai.
While many foreign investors hold the yuan on the assumption it is set to rise, slim returns are a sore point nonetheless, especially since similar yuan investment on mainland China can earn up to 3 percentage points more.
At the heart of Beijing's push to raise the yuan's international profile is a desire to have a currency that matches its growing clout, and the hope of cutting China's reliance on the dollar.
To that end, China wants firms to not just rely on the U.S. currency when settling trade.
China's experiment with using Hong Kong as a place outside the mainland where the yuan can trade, and as a test bed where capital controls can be gradually eased, has met with great success.
Yuan deposits in Hong Kong have surged over seven times to more than half a trillion yuan in less than two years, making it more pressing for banks -- and Beijing -- to give foreign owners of the yuan more attractive investment options.
"Not only is Beijing still comfortable with the rapid pace of offshore yuan market development, it is taking the yuan internationalization process to the next stage," HSBC said.
"By opening up a significant channel for yuan inflows back to onshore asset markets, (it is) closing the circle for the global circulation of China's currency," the bank said.
Indeed, Li made clear that China is ready to provide Hong Kong with more investment avenues for its yuan deposits.
He said mainland companies are now allowed to sell bonds in the territory, a shift from before when only financial companies could issue bonds in Hong Kong.
To anchor the yuan bond market, Li said Beijing is committed to selling Treasury bonds in Hong Kong.
"Issuing renminbi treasury bonds in Hong Kong will be a long term institutional arrangement of the central government," Li said.
"We will gradually increase the size of insurance and work for the development and improvement of the renminbi bond market in Hong Kong," he said.
Li's remarks came as China sold 20 billion yuan ($3.1 billion) of bonds in its biggest-ever issue, adding depth to a fast-growing market.
"It's all very positive," Bonn Liu, a partner-in-charge at KPMG China Capital Markets, said of Li's announcements. "It's a step out for the yuan."
