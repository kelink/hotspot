UPDATE 2-Ghana's GNPC to buy Kosmos stake on own-source

(Reuters) - State oil firm Ghana National Petroleum Corp (GNPC) intends to buy Kosmos Energy's stake in the giant Jubilee oil field offshore the West African country on its own, a GNPC source said on Tuesday.
"We are not going for a joint bid with any rival company. GNPC has the money to acquire all the stake," the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
China's Sinopec had offered to make a joint bid with GNPC but the Ghanaian firm rejected this offer, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal on Monday.
Earlier this month, Exxon Mobil Corp (
) agreed to buy the Jubilee stake from Kosmos, Reuters reported, but GNPC said the sale was illegal.
The source said GNPC would be willing to go into a partnership with another company after buying Kosmos' share of the field, one of the biggest oil finds in West Africa in the past decade. It is due to begin producing oil commercially in late 2010.
"We will accept proposals from companies we deem appropriate -- companies that ... demonstrate that they are ready to obey the rules of Ghana," the GNPC source said.
Kosmos, which is backed by private equity groups Blackstone Group (
) and Warburg Pincus [WP.UL], has a 30.875 percent stake in the West Cape Three Points block and an 18 percent interest in the Deepwater Tano block offshore Ghana.
"If after acquiring the stake we are able to resolve the issues about illegalities, GNPC will be open to all interested companies, including Exxon, but we haven't reached that point yet," the source said.
Projected oil revenue is seen as crucial to economic growth in Ghana, whose main exports are gold and cocoa. The country is struggling with inflation that has hovered around 20 percent since the start of the year and a large fiscal deficit.
