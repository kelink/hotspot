(Reuters) - Kuwait's finance minister said on Thursday that oil trading will remain in U.S. dollars, the latest denial of a report this week of a move to replace it with a basket of currencies.
British newspaper The Independent reported on Tuesday, citing unidentified sources, that Gulf Arab states were in secret talks with Russia, China, Japan and France to replace the dollar in trading oil.
"This is not on the cards," said Mustapha al-Shamali on a visit to London, when he was asked if there was a chance of replacing the dollar.
"There are some newspapers that bring these issues up, but there is nothing in it. It will remain as this for some time because trading in the dollar is not an issue."
The dollar has been undermined by the U.S. trade and budgetary deficits, and its role as the globe's top reserve currency has come under question. Oil exporters have sometimes complained dollar weakness undermines the purchasing power of oil revenues.
On Thursday, the dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while oil rose, trading above $70 a barrel. .DXY. The greenback had also weakened after the Independent's report.
Saudi Arabia and some other Gulf states peg their currencies to the dollar. But Kuwait links its currency, the dinar, to a basket of currencies.
Kuwait has never said what the components of the currency basket are, but analysts believe it is dominated by the dollar.
The finance minister added that Kuwait will keep the oil price assumed in next year's budget the same as the current year at $35 a barrel, as it was unclear if current levels will persist.
"We are not sure yet that prices will continue at this level," he said. The minister was in London to sign a trade agreement with Britain. (Additional reporting by Rania El Gamal in Kuwait; Writing by Alex Lawler; Editing by Keiron Henderson)
