* OZ urges shareholders to stick with Minmetals' bid
* Says proposals not superior to bid (Adds details, share reaction)
SYDNEY, June 9
) has rejected two recapitalisation proposals, saying they were not superior to a $1.2 billion agreed takeover by China's Minmetals, OZ said on Tuesday.
OZ reaffirmed its commitment to Minmetals' proposal and urged shareholders vote in favour of deal at a meeting on Thursday.
OZ Minerals, which needs to raise money to repay A$1.1 billion ($863 million) in debt, did not say who made the alternative proposals.
Late on Friday, investment advisory firm RFC Group and Royal Bank of Canada (
OZ Minerals shares gained 2.8 percent to A$0.91, outpacing a 0.4 percent rise in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index .AXJO.
The proposals were bolstered by a recent rally in OZ Minerals' shares and a pick-up in commodity prices. Some shareholders have also questioned the Minmetals' offer as it was below the $1.4-$1.6 billion value arrived by an valuation expert.
OZ Minerals said despite the recent increases, the current zinc price is at the bottom of the range of long-run real zinc prices used by the expert. The current copper price is only marginally above the top end of the range used by the expert, it said.
OZ's reaffirmation of its Chinese deal comes only days after Rio Tinto Ltd (
) scrapped a $19.5 billion tie-up plan with another Chinese state owned firm, Chinalco [ID:nSYD73514].
OZ has received all regulatory approvals for the Minmetals deal. ($1=A$1.25) (Reporting by Denny Thomas;)
