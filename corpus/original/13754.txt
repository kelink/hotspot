(Reuters) - China Investment Corp (CIC), the country's $200 billion sovereign wealth fund, has agreed to buy a 40 percent stake in investment firm CITIC Capital Holdings Ltd, the official China Securities Journal reported on Monday.
CIC will buy new shares to be issued by Hong Kong-based CITIC Capital, in which CITIC Pacific (
) and CITIC International Financial Holdings Ltd each hold 50 percent, the newspaper said, citing a letter sent to CITIC Capital investors. It gave no figure for the value of the deal.
Both CITIC Pacific and CITIC International are units of CITIC Group, China's biggest financial conglomerate.
CIC has shown renewed interest in overseas acquisitions, as global stock markets rebound in the wake of pro-growth fiscal and monetary policies aimed at pulling the world economy out of the worst financial crisis in half a century.
CITIC Capital, established in 2002, operates businesses including private equity investment, real estate funds, structured finance and alternative investments, the newspaper said.
