(Reuters) - Managers of last month's top performing global emerging markets funds are cautious on the prospects for the coming months following a strong rally in May.
The Lipper Global index of Global Emerging Markets funds returned 17.82 percent in May, led by HSBC's BRIC funds, Parvest and Mark Mobius's Templeton BRIC fund. For a full table of fund leaders and laggards in the sector, see below.

Alex Tarver, a global emerging markets product specialist at HSBC Asset Management (
) said May had seen surging stock markets underpin BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) fund performance.
The HSBC GIF BRIC Freestyle M1C USD fund, returned 28.12 percent last month, but Tarver said more solid evidence of an economic recovery would be needed to sustain recent investor confidence. "There are signs that one should be taking more risk but at the same time we're not completely clear on the outlook," Tarver said. "We've been playing the game but if you fly too fast then you might notice if something were to flip the other way." The fund had a small overweight position in Russia during May and moved further underweight in China during the month. It remains neutral on Brazil and India. The fund's managers currently favour Brazilian small and mid cap stocks, Indian industrials, and energy stocks in Russia. Allan Conway, manager of Schroders ISF BRIC A Acc which returned 19.58 percent in May, expects a correction of up to 10-15 percent in BRIC markets in the months ahead but expects them to lead the recovery over the next one to two years. "For a true bull market to take place you actually need to see visibility of the recovery," Conway said. "The green shoots of recovery are very tenuous." Conway currently favours China and sees value Russia but says Brazil and India are fairly valued. Among the laggards in May First State Investments' Global Emerging Markets Leaders A GBP rose 3.59 percent in the month largely missing out on the rally due to its focus on less cyclical companies. Fund manager Jonathan Asante said BRIC markets are becoming expensive and favours stocks in South Africa, particularly drinks manufacturer SAB Miller (
) which he predicts will perform well in the next few years. The fund also likes Indian IT stocks which have been hugely derated over recent years and shuns resources stocks.
