* Chairman says acquisitions, own branches both possibilities
) is interested in tapping the Taiwan market, through either acquisitions or the establishment of its own branches, its chairman said on Wednesday.
CCB is the second major Chinese lender, after Bank of China (
), to express a clear interest in Taiwan opportunities after the mainland and Taiwan signed a financial services pact on Monday.
"We are interested," Guo Shuqing told reporters on the sidelines of a forum in response to a question about CCB's plan for the Taiwanese market.
Guo said CCB had no specific plans yet but, when pressed further about whether it aimed to open its own branch or acquire an existing Taiwanese firm, he said: "We do not rule out either of them."
"The economic links between the mainland and Taiwan have been quite close. There are a lot of financial transactions going on, so there will be a lot of opportunities," he said.
The much-anticipated MOU will take effect around mid-January, he said.
On Tuesday, Bank of China said it was in the final stages of plans to set up branches in Taiwan and that it would apply for regulatory approval as soon as possible. [ID:nPEK201714] (Reporting by Michael Wei and Jason Subler; Editing by Ken Wills)
