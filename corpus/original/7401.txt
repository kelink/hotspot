Developed and developing nations, gathered at a December 7-18 U.N. climate conference in Copenhagen, remain deeply divided on emissions cuts and legal details in talks to agree the outline of a pact to extend or replace the existing Kyoto Protocol.
Many rich nations, including Japan, want a single new treaty that would set curbs on emissions by all major nations and are against simply extending the Kyoto agreement.
The United States never ratified Kyoto and is not among the 37 industrialized nations committed to emissions targets during Kyoto's 2008-20012 first commitment period.
Poor nations prefer a two-track approach, which would extend Kyoto with deep emissions cuts for the rich, while creating a new, less binding accord for the poor.
Japanese Environment Minister Sakihito Ozawa, speaking before leaving for the Copenhagen talks, said Japan would reiterate that its emissions cut target, based on 1990 levels, was premised on ambitious goals being agreed by all major emitters.
Japan had no plan to offer an alternative, watered-down pledge, he said.
"There's no meaning to simply extending a Kyoto Protocol that doesn't include the United States or numbers from China," Ozawa told a news conference.
"We're not at all thinking of (pledging) a number in that case."
Ozawa declined to say how much Japan would offer in extra funding to developing countries to fight climate change, though he said the government still wanted to pay more than a previously announced $9.2 billion until 2012.
Japan's government has come under fire over its target from business groups at home, worried about extra costs hurting industries ranging from power generation and steel to cement, just as the economy is seen at risk of a second recession.
