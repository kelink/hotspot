(Reuters) - U.S. copper futures fell to a near two-week low Wednesday morning, extending a correction from last week's rally to eight-month highs and trending lower amid an increased focus on the market's weaker fundamental backdrop.
The metal failed to derive support from the dollar, which slipped against the euro in response to lower-than-expected inflation data.
