The United States had already levied preliminary duties up to 429 percent on the Chinese-made imported pipe, which is used in oil drilling, but Tuesday's ruling was a final one that moves the investigation a step forward.
The United States imported $119.2 million worth of steel drill pipe in 2009, according to the department, and imports from China more than doubled from 2006 to 2008.
If the commission says that has happened, Commerce will impose anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders designed to push prices for Chinese-made drill pipe up to levels that are competitive with those charged by U.S. producers.
