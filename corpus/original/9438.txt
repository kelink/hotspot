added 1.78 percent to 66,462.77, erasing more than half of its 2.9 percent loss on Tuesday, when a new 2 percent tax on financial transactions on foreign investments in Brazilian stocks and fixed-income securities took effect.
The country's currency, the real BRBY fell 2.1 percent on Tuesday, but on Wednesday strengthened 0.46 percent to 1.740 per U.S. dollar. It is up about 34 percent to the dollar so far in 2009.
The Bovespa index has shot up 74 percent in 2009 through Tuesday's close as Brazil's economy has ridden out the global economic crises with less damage than many other countries.
"The global backdrop will continue to dictate the direction of asset prices in Brazil," Vinicius Silva, an equities strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York.
A slew of data from China, set for release overnight, will probably trump the news of the tax, Silva said.
China's voracious appetite for commodities and continued growth has helped countries such as Brazil, where a number of heavyweight companies are tied to the trade in raw materials.
Those stocks include energy company Petrobras and mining giant Vale, the two most heavily weighted stocks in the index.

Yields on Brazilian interest rate futures contracts <0#DIJ:> largely slid, especially among longer-term contracts.
Both were among the morning's most highly-traded contracts.
Investors use the contracts to bet on trends in Brazil's benchmark interest rate, the Selic, now at 8.75 percent.
Central bank policy-makers conclude a two-day meeting on Wednesday, and analysts expect the Selic to remain unchanged through at least the end of the year.
Less certain is when policy-makers will begin tightening after having hacked 500 basis points off the Selic in 2009 to jump-start the country's flagging economy.
Though Brazil resumed growth in the second quarter, inflationary risks remain low, government officials have noted. Yet as the recovery gathers steam, analysts weigh the chance that the bank will begin hiking the rate sometime in 2010. (Reporting by Luciana Lopez. editing by W Simon)
