(Reuters) - U.S. apparel brand Gap Inc opened an online store on China's biggest e-commerce platform Taobao on Wednesday, in an effort to lure savvy Chinese shoppers outside wealthy cities.
Gap opened its store on Taobao Mall, alongside the likes of Adidas AG, Levi Strauss & Co and Japan's Uniqlo, Taobao said in a statement. Taobao, a unit of Alibaba Group that is 40 percent owned by Yahoo Inc, commands more than 70 percent of all online e-commerce transactions by gross merchandise volume.
"Given China is the cornerstone of Gap Inc's global growth strategy, we believe that partnering with Taobao, with its phenomenal reach all throughout the country, is an important next step," John Ermatinger, president of Gap's Asia Pacific region said in a statement.
