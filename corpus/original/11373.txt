- It succeeded in reining in a ballooning budget deficit to meet the EU's targets in 2006 and made much progress in its aim to balance the budget before the economic downturn hit. Now the government expects the public sector deficit to swell to some 6 percent of GDP next year, twice the EU budget rules' limit.
- Seen as one of its biggest failures, the grand coalition delivered a messy compromise on a health reform aimed at tackling ballooning costs and bureaucracy.
- It has introduced a centralised fund to pool and distribute contributions from workers to health insurers and the government also contributes a limited amount of tax money. But the fund already has a deficit of 3 billion euros and has been criticised for doing little to improve the system's funding problems and failing to ease the burden on workers.
- Led by Merkel, the coalition mended ties with the United States which were badly damaged over the Iraq war.
- Germany sent a naval deployment to the Lebanese coast as part of a U.N. peacekeeping mission in 2006 after Israel's war with Hezbollah. It is the first time Germany has got involved militarily in the Middle East since World War Two.
- It has boosted the number of German troops in NATO's Afghanistan mission to about 4,200 but has resisted pressure to send soldiers to the more dangerous South of the country.
- At a Group of Eight industrialised nations summit in 2007, Merkel brokered a deal to "seriously consider" carbon emissions cuts of 50 percent by 2050 which laid the foundations for a more ambitious agreement in Italy this year.
- Germany drew criticism from other countries for being slow to respond to the financial crisis. But the coalition passed two stimulus programmes worth a total of 81 billion euros ($116 billion). Although the downturn has hit Europe's biggest economy hard, it emerged from recession in the second quarter.
- However, there has been more criticism of the coalition's attempts to restructure its banking system.
- The public-owned Landesbanks still face problems, however, and critics say the next government might have to devote more resources to bailing them out. (Compiled by Madeline Chambers; Editing by Charles Dick)
