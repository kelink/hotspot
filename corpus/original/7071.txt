Last month's accord, falling far short of many countries' hopes, seeks to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial times, with the prospect of an annual $100 billion in climate aid for the poor from 2020.
The deal was not adopted by the U.N. summit on December 19 after objections by a few developing nations. That triggered a demand for all to take sides by January 31. So far, no major nations have announced tougher goals than those before Copenhagen.
CHINA (22 percent), INDIA (6), SOUTH AFRICA (1), BRAZIL (1) -- known as the BASIC group. India's Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh said in a January 28 letter to Friis that BASIC ministers "underscored their support to the Copenhagen Accord" at a January 24 meeting. The five also challenged donors to deliver on promises of aid.
-- China said on November 26 it would cut the amount of carbon produced per unit of economic output by 40 to 45 percent below projected growth levels by 2020 from 2005. The "carbon intensity" goal would let emissions keep rising, but more slowly than economic growth.
-- South Africa offered on December 6 to slow the growth of its emissions by 34 percent below projected levels by 2020, conditional on a broad international deal and aid.
-- Brazil reaffirmed on December 28 a goal announced before Copenhagen of reducing emissions by between 36 and 39 percent below projected levels by 2020. At the most ambitious end of the range, it said emissions would fall by 20 percent from 2005 levels back to 1994 levels.
UNITED STATES (18) - U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern said on January 28 that the country would aim to cut emissions by about 17 percent by 2020, from 2005 levels, confirming a goal set by the White House late last year. The target -- 4 percent below 1990 levels -- may be harder to achieve after the Democrats lost a key Senate seat.
EUROPEAN UNION (15) - Reiterated on January 27 an offer of a unilateral goal of a 20 percent emissions cut by 2020, from 1990 levels, and 30 percent if other nations deepened their reductions.
JAPAN (4) - Japan's foreign ministry said on January 26 that it was reiterating an offer to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 -- on condition other emitters led by China and the United States agreed an ambitious deal.
AUSTRALIA (1) - Australia reaffirmed its 5 to 25 percent emissions cut range, below 2000 levels and corresponding to 3-23 percent under 1990, the government said on January 27 [ID:nSGE60Q08A]. A decision to move beyond a unilateral 5 percent would not happen until the "level of global ambition becomes sufficiently clear."
NORWAY - Reiterated on January 28 a unilateral promise to cut emissions by 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, and by 40 percent if other nations set tougher goals [ID:nLDE60R0WV].
The U.S. Climate Action Network also published letters from BANGLADESH, SAMOA, THE MARSHALL ISLANDS and MACEDONIA expressing support for the accord. THE PHILIPPINES said it will back the deal if rich nations in the next few months make "deep and early cuts" in emissions.
