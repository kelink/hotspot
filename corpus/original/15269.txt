BofA-Merrill's Keyes leaving to rejoin Morgan Stanley

(Reuters) - Terence Keyes, Asia head of the general execution group for Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, is leaving the bank to return to his previous employer, Morgan Stanley, people with knowledge of the matter said on Friday.
Keyes, a former top Morgan Stanley banker in Asia who worked at Morgan Stanley for 11 years, joined Merrill Lynch last April as head of Asia corporate finance and was given the new title late last year after Bank of America acquired Merrill Lynch.
Keyes is expected to rejoin Morgan Stanley in the near term to take a similar role to his senior position at Merrill Lynch, said the sources.
But no formal agreement had been signed, and the specifics of Keyes's role at Morgan Stanley are still being finalized, said the sources, who declined to be identified because of the confidential nature of the hiring process.
Usually, a senior banking professional may be contractually barred from taking a similar post at a rival bank within a certain period of time after his departure, in order to avoid potential conflicts-of-interest.
At Merrill Lynch, Keyes's team focused on deal execution and worked closely with other departments to help Asian companies underwrite shares and bonds.
Keyes, a Briton, moved to Hong Kong with SG Warburg in 1994 and later joined Morgan Stanley, where his last position was as senior managing director in charge of deal execution.
In 2005, Keyes helped China Construction Bank, China's top property lender, raise $9.2 billion in an initial public offering of shares that was the world's largest in the previous four years at that time and the first by one of China's Big Four state lenders.
After a severe downturn caused by the financial crisis, hiring at investment banks, consultancies, auditing and law firms has begun to pick up in the past few months as some global markets show signs of recovering.
