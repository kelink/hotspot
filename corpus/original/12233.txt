US CO2 emissions from fuels to fall 5 pct in 2009

(Reuters) - U.S. emissions of the main greenhouse gas from tailpipes and smokestacks should fall a record 5 percent in 2009 as the recession crimps demand for fuels but should begin to edge up next year, the government's energy forecaster said on Tuesday.
"The economic downturn, combined with natural gas displacing some coal as a source of electricity generation, is projected to lead to a 5 percent decline in fossil-fuel based (carbon dioxide) emissions in 2009," the Energy Information Administration said in its monthly forecast.
It was the first time the EIA, the statistics arm of the Department of Energy, published the predictions on carbon emissions from the burning of coal, natural gas and petroleum.
Even with the recession-related drop, the United States will remain by far the largest polluter on a per capita basis of the gases blamed for global warming, and the second largest emitter overall behind China.
Total U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, which represent about 80 percent of overall U.S. greenhouse gas output, have jumped nearly 16 percent from 1990 to 2008, the EIA said in May.
And "an improving economy" should raise annual carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels by 0.7 percent next year, the EIA said.
U.S. carbon emissions from fossil fuels should slip under 5.5 million tonnes in 2009, from nearly 5.8 million tonnes last year, and rise to more than 5.5 million tonnes next year, the EIA said.
Fuel switching by electricity generators and declines in industrial use were projected to lead to a 7.9 percent decline in carbon emissions from coal burning in 2009, EIA said. Emissions from coal were expected to rise 1.1. percent next year.
Natural gas consumption was expected to fall in 2009 due to the downturn and despite being used more to generate power. That should lead to a carbon emissions decline of 2.3 percent from natural gas in 2009, the EIA said.
Petroleum emissions were expected to fall 4 percent in 2009, mostly due to declines in transportation. The EIA expected little change in carbon emissions from use of motor gasoline in 2009, but it expected 9.8 percent less emissions from jet fuel and an 8.2 percent decline in emissions from distillates fuels, which include diesel for trucks. Emissions from residual fuel, which is burned to generate electricity, were also expected to be down.
The EIA cut the monthly forecast for annual U.S. oil demand in 2009 by 140,000 barrels per day to 18.71 million bpd. It now expects this year's oil demand to be 790,000 bpd lower than last year.
The agency also cut the forecast for annual coal demand from power generators to 975 million tons, down 12 million tons from last month's outlook. That would be an annual drop in demand of 6.4 percent from 2008. Coal consumption by power generators was expected to rise 1.3 percent next year.
