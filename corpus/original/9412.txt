(Reuters) - Japan's multiple Olympic swimming champion Kosuke Kitajima will return to competition next month, ending a 15-month break since last year's Beijing Games.
The 27-year-old will swim the 50, 100 and 200 metres breaststroke at a Nov. 20-23 event at Tokyo Swimming Centre, raising the prospect of a full comeback.
Organisers told Reuters on Thursday that Kitajima had formally entered the competition, ending more than a year of speculation about his future in the sport.
Kitajima skipped this year's world championships in Rome after successfully defending his 100 and 200 metre Olympics titles at Beijing in 2008.
Kitajima recently indicated he may enter next year's Japanese national championships and Japanese officials are hoping to persuade him to race at at next year's Pan Pacific championships in California and the Asian Games in Guangzhou, China.
