METALS-Copper eases; investors wary on demand despite data
2009-07-16 15:05:00.0
(Reuters) - Copper ended down on Thursday, giving back a fraction of the week's strong gains even though upbeat corporate earnings in the United states and robust growth data from China gave fresh signs the world economy may have passed the worst.
Copper for September delivery HGU9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division eased 0.25 cent to close at $2.3895 a lb, after dealing between $2.3570 and $2.41, its highest level since June 12.
On the London Metal Exchange (LME), copper for three month delivery MCU3 shed $3 to settle at $5,260 a tonne.
Analysts warn the outlook remains shaky, but voice growing confidence that the global slowdown is nonetheless easing.
"We're getting more and more economic data that suggests we have passed the worst and that we are pulling out of this slump," said David Thurtell at Citi, adding that Thursday's decline was a small adjustment after hefty recent gains.
Copper, used in power and construction, is up 7.6 percent so far this week after upbeat U.S. economic and corporate data, and hit a one-month high of $5,284 on Wednesday.
"The market's are taking a breather today," said Tom Hartman, broker with Altavest Worldwide Trading in Mission Viejo, California.
"The story out of China is certainly one to note as it could be the first of the major economies to be pulling out of the recession," he added.
China's growth sped up to hit 7.9 percent in the second quarter, fueled by state spending and bank lending, reinforcing hopes it will lead the world economy out of its deepest recession in 80 years. [ID:nSP537798]
Investors have been viewing the dollar as a hedge against risk, and a stronger U.S. currency makes dollar-priced metals more expensive for holders of other currencies.
MARKET TIGHTNESS ?
LME copper inventories shed 225 tonnes to 260,875 tonnes. These low stock levels, combined with favorable supply and demand fundamentals, will benefit copper ahead of most other LME metals, Investec Asset Management said. [ID:nLF335603]
"As the economic recovery gathers speed in emerging markets, the demand for base metals will likely continue to improve even if the recovery stalls in the developed markets, given the leverage copper demand has to China and the emerging markets," said Goldman Sachs in a note.
Aluminum MAL3 was untraded at the close but was last bid at $1,690 from $1,655. The demand outlook for the metal used in transport and packaging remains a concern, with stocks at record levels over 4.5 million tonnes. It hit a day's high of $1,685, its highest since June 26.
Steel-making ingredient nickel MNI3 closed at $16,100 from $15,940 while battery material lead MPB3 closed at $1,620 versus $1,635.
Zinc MZN3 was untraded at the close but was last bid at $1,549 from $1,542, and tin MSN3, which was also untraded at the close, was last bid at $13,025 from $13,300.
Traders also remain concerned about the scale of long positions in the tin market, compared with the amount of available metal in LME warehouses. [ID:nL6246168]
