UPDATE 2-Canpotex inks potash contracts in Korea, Taiwan

(Reuters) - Potash Corp of Saskatchewan (
Potash Corp, the world's largest fertilizer maker, said the new contract that varied based on the grade of potash, priced in the range of $700 a tonne on a delivered basis.
Last month, Canpotex signed a contract with Japanese customers covering shipments for the second half of 2009, which were priced at similar levels.
The price of potash -- a key crop nutrient -- has remained stubbornly high even as demand has collapsed, as a small group of companies, which account for roughly 75 percent of global potash supply, have drastically cut production in a bid to maintain pricing.
Analysts and investors are keenly awaiting the outcome of contract negotiations with China and India, as global potash spot market prices are typically pegged above these key contract prices.
"Due to small volumes, these transactions (with Korea and Taiwan) are not expected to have a meaningful impact on price discovery to larger markets such as China and India, as well as Brazil and Southeast Asia," BMO Capital Markets analyst Edwin Chee said in a note to clients.
China is the world's largest potash buyer and it typically negotiates annual contracts with Belarussian Potash Co (BPC) and Canpotex, at a substantial discount to spot market prices.
BPC is a 50-50 joint venture between Russia's Uralkali (
) and Belaruskali, while Canpotex is a partnership between Potash Corp, Mosaic Co (
). These five companies along with K+S SDFG.DE and Russia's Silvinit SILV.RTS account for about 75 percent of global potash supply.
