(Reuters) - China's state assets watchdog warned centrally-controlled state companies on Wednesday to step up checks over their derivatives trading to avoid potential risks.
The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) ordered all central government-controlled state companies engaging in trading derivatives to make quarterly reports about their investment situations, according to a statement published on the agency's website (www.sasac.gov.cn).
It said the companies should report their holdings of futures, options, forwards and swaps, and investment performances, to the watchdog within 10 working days of the end of each quarter.
"All central state companies should strengthen oversight of derivatives trading and make a timely analysis of their holdings, capital settlements, new business, gains or losses, hedging activities and risk exposure," it said.
