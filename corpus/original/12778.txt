(Reuters) - Britain's blue chip shares hit a new high for the year in midday trade on Monday, as gains in Barclays and HSBC led a rally in the banking sector, while rising commodity prices pushed miners and oil majors higher.
By 1059 GMT the FTSE 100 was up 1.5 percent or 69.32 points at 4,677.68, easing off a peak of 4,693.06, its highest since early October 2008.
"There is a big sigh of relief. The banks are doing very well," said Philip Lawlor, chief portfolio strategist at Nomura.
"But we have to ask what return on equity do we think these guys are going to be allowed to deliver. Ultimately that dictates the valuation the market will put on them. That debate isn't being fully had at the moment but it won't be long before we transition to that," he said.
HSBC rose 6 percent as it reported a pretax profit for the six months to the end of June of $5.02 billion, down from $10.2 billion a year earlier but just ahead of an average forecast from 11 analysts polled by Reuters.
Barclays added 7.3 points even as it fell short of expectations with an 8 percent rise in half-year profit, as bad debts almost doubled to offset buoyant earnings from its enlarged investment bank.
"Barclays' numbers came in below estimates but they have to be put in perspective. They're better than last year," said Keith Bowman, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
