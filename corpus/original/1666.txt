If state-owned China National Gold makes a bid for all of African Barrick, it would rank as the biggest Chinese deal in Africa since China Guangdong Nuclear Power Corp's GDNCP.UL $3.37 billion takeover of uranium developer Kalahari Minerals and its partner, Extract Resources, in Namibia earlier this year.

The gold deal would also be the biggest ever made by China National Gold and a takeover of African Barrick, Tanzania's largest gold producer, would increase its reserves by a third.
China National Gold calls itself the country's top gold company by production and resources with 1,565 tonnes, or 50.3 million ounces, in gold reserves as of June. China Gold mined 1 million ounces of gold in 2011, compared with 688,000 ounces produced by African Barrick.

The demand is being driven by China's increasing affluence, which leads to higher demand for jewellery and gold is being used as a hedge against inflation by Chinese investors.
Barrick said there was no certainty the talks would result in a bid for all or part of its 74 percent stake in the African unit, worth almost 1.3 billion pounds at current prices.
Should China National Gold buy more than 30 percent of the voting interest in African Barrick, it would be required to make an offer for the whole company.
The Chinese company is looking to double mined gold output to 2 million ounces a year by 2015, China National Gold's vice president, Song Quanli, told Reuters recently, adding that the company was also expanding into non-ferrous metals.
It expects to book revenue of 100 billion yuan ($15.7 billion) this year, which would be three years ahead of its target.
