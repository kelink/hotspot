(Reuters) - Russia plans to ban the production and sale of all types of incandescent light bulb from Jan. 1, 2014, in a move designed to reduce energy consumption, Economy Minister Elvira Nabiullina said on Thursday.
The ban will be the final stage in Russia's plan to phase out the standard, high-energy light bulbs and mirrors a move already under way in the European Union to switch toward less energy-intensive lighting sources.
Nabiullina told a news conference making and selling incandescent bulbs with a power rating of more than 100 watts, which account for about 14 percent of all bulbs used in Russia, would be banned from Jan. 1, 2011.
From Jan. 1, 2013, incandescent bulbs with a power rating of more than 75 watts will follow suit.
European households are already switching to more efficient halogen, LED (light-emitting diode) and fluorescent CFL lamps. The European Union plans to phase out incandescent bulbs by 2012.
Industry bodies have said thousands of jobs in the European Union could be lost, mostly in eastern Europe, as the new regulations favour China-based manufacturers of CFL bulbs.

Light bulbs are also major consumers of tungsten, a hard metal used in the filament.
"As far as the second and third stages are concerned, the targets for 2013 and 2014, these will not be fixed rigidly in law," senior Kremlin economic aide Arkady Dvorkovich said at the same briefing.
"We need to see how the first stage works ... but I think this timetable is entirely realistic," Dvorkovich said. (Writing by Robin Paxton, editing by Will Waterman)
