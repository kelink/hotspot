) posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, helped primarily by better cost-control efforts.
The company's shares were trading up 41 cents at $16.62 after the bell. They closed at $16.21 Thursday on Nasdaq.
Scientific Games said gross margins rose to 43 percent in the second quarter from 40 percent a year earlier, driven by local instant ticket production in China, lower but more profitable lottery systems sales and cost savings.
Last year, the company reduced capital expenditures and slashed jobs as part of a cost-cutting initiative to improve profitability. It had also announced that its China-related lottery-ticket printing operations would be shifted to that country.
The company, which makes lottery tickets, gaming machines and pre-paid mobile phone cards, posted a net income of $20.3 million, or 22 cents a share, compared with $25.8 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier.
According to Reuters Estimates, the company earned 20 cents a share, including stock-based compensation but excluding other items, topping analysts' consensus view of 17 cents.
For the quarter ended June 30, revenue fell 26 percent to $225 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses fell 20 percent to $39.1 million. (Reporting by Mihir Dalal in Bangalore; Editing by Deepak Kannan)
