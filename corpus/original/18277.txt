(Reuters) - A Defense Department employee was charged on Wednesday with conspiring to give classified information to a Chinese government agent, the Justice Department said.
James Fondren, 62, turned himself in to federal authorities and faces a maximum of five years in jail in a spy case that has led to guilty pleas and jail sentences for three other participants including Tai Shen Kuo, a U.S. citizen born in Taiwan.
While working as a civilian employee at the Pentagon with a top-secret clearance, Fondren gave Kuo classified data on a Chinese military official's U.S. visit, a joint U.S.-Chinese naval exercise and other items between November 2004 and February 2008, according to the charges.
Kuo worked under the direction of a Chinese government official, but he misled Fondren into believing he was providing information for Taiwan military officials, the Justice Department said.
The arrest affidavit said Fondren was aware, however, the information was going to an agent of a federal government.
"Providing classified information to a foreign agent of the People's Republic of China is a real and serious threat to our national security," Dana Boente, acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement.
Fondren, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, has been on administrative leave from the Pentagon with pay since February 2008.
Two others, Gregg Bergersen, a former Defense Department employee, and Yu Xin Kang, an accomplice of Kuo, also received jail terms in the case.
