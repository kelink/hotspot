SCENARIOS: Fallout of Obama's higher budget deficit estimates
2009-05-11 13:45:00.0
(Reuters) - The Obama administration revised its estimate of U.S. budget deficits, adding $176 billion to the already huge federal government shortfall for this year and next.
* Republicans are likely to pounce on the new data, saying it underscores Democratic President Barack Obama's failure -- even this early into his presidency -- to tackle fiscal problems that began in the Republican Bush administration.
But with a fiscal 2010 budget already passed by the Democratic-led Congress, the outline for overall government spending next year has already been put into place.
* The U.S. debt, now at $11.27 trillion, will swell more rapidly if the Obama administration's projections prove accurate. Higher government debt can lead to higher borrowing costs for consumers -- from mortgages on houses to credit card costs. Much of the U.S. debt is now being financed by China, Japan and other foreign countries and interest costs on the debt are costing U.S. taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars a year.
* While the White House is now forecasting a $1.84 trillion deficit this year, up by $89 billion from a previous estimate, total projected deficits over the next 10 years are seen almost staying the same -- rising to $7.1 trillion in 2010-2019, instead of just under $7 trillion for that period.
* Democrats in the White House and Congress might cite the larger deficits as further proof that quick action has to be taken to reform healthcare in the United States, a top priority of the administration. Obama has argued that such reforms would lower the government's costs in the Medicare and Medicaid healthcare programs for the elderly and poor. These rising costs are accounting for more and more of the budget deficit.
