Following are the highlights of a news conference by Li Xiaochao, the spokesman of the National Bureau of Statistics.
"We have stressed the proactive fiscal policy and appropriately relaxed monetary stance to keep consistency and stability in economic policy -- according to my understanding, that means no change in policy.
"In the next phase, we will stick to the continuity and stability of our macro economic policy.
"China's economy is at a vital moment of recovery and stabilization. The foundations of the recovery are still not solid, the pressure on external demand is still serious and it is still an arduous task for us to expand domestic demand and adjust the structure of the economy.
"As for the dollar's depreciation, we have to emphasize that it is another demonstration of the uncertainty we face right now in the external environment."
-- Consumer and producer prices have been rising month on month since July, narrowing the year-on-year declines of both the CPI and PPI gauges.
"What we need to emphasize is that although government-initiated investment grew fast, it mainly went to weaker sectors of the economy, so it will be conducive to relatively fast economic development in the long run."
-- Investment contributed 7.3 percentage points to headline growth of 7.7 percent, and consumption accounted for 4.0 percentage points.
