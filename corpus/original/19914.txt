(Reuters) - Husky Energy Inc (
) plans to spin off its Southeast Asian assets, including the huge Liwan gas field, into a separate company to boost its share value, once it sees some economic stability, the company's chief executive said on Tuesday.
The new company would be listed on an Asian stock exchange, have its own management and board, and require little capital from Husky, CEO John Lau said after the Canadian oil producer and refiner's annual meeting.
The Asian properties owned by Husky, the energy firm controlled by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, have low costs and a strong partner in China's state oil firm CNOOC Ltd (
), Lau said.
"I think that the flotation, or IPO, will have a huge response from the market," he said.
Husky shares jumped more than 3 percent after Lau's comments. They were up 52 Canadian cents, or nearly 2 percent, at C$29.12 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Tuesday afternoon.
