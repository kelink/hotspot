SHANGHAI/HONG KONG, June 8
Feng did not provide further details of the move, which many analysts had expected and which would give the combined carriers more than half of the market in Shanghai, a fiercely competitive city among domestic and foreign carriers.
China Eastern executives declined to comment. In a later statement the company said it was in the middle of restructuring plans and was planning proposals to lower its gearing ratio, but gave no further details.
"Uncertainties remain with the relevant matters," the firm said. For a full statement, click:
After years of double-digit growth, China's airlines are facing strong headwinds due to the global economic slowdown. China's top three carriers, including Air China and China Southern Airlines, lost more than $4 billion in 2008.
Shanghai Air, which has lost money for two straight years since 2007, will be delisted if it fails to turn around this year, according to China's securities rules.
"I am not saying that merger is a cure-all but at least it gives them a chance to work together rather than fighting with each other especially at a time like this," said Li Lei, an analyst with China Securities Co.
Sources familiar with the situation told Reuters in October the government was discussing the possibility of brokering a merger of China Eastern and Shanghai Air to create a dominant player with a roughly 60 percent share of domestic flights in China's financial hub.
Merger talks speeded up after the debt-ridden carriers got financial aid from the government, an industry source said. (Reporting by Joseph Chaney, Donny Kwok and Fang Yan; Editing by David Holmes)
