UPDATE 3-Syniverse to buy Verisign messaging ops for $175 mln
2009-08-25 14:10:00.0
(Reuters) - Syniverse Holdings SVR.N said it would buy Verisign Inc's (
) messaging business for $175 million and expects the combined business to grow about 10 percent annually, sending its shares soaring more than a quarter.
The wireless voice and data services provider, whose customers include AT&T Inc (
), Telefonica (
), hopes to ride on rising demand for smart phones and netbooks.
Smartphones would account for 29 percent of the entire mobile phone market in 2012, compared with 14 percent in 2009, Samsung Mobile Display predicted in a statement in April.
"This is an important strategic move," Syniverse Chief Executive Tony Holcombe said on a conference call with analysts.
"Mobile messaging transactions, the fastest growing segment in wireless communications, continue to increase in volume and positively impact the bottomlines of organizations in the mobile telecom space," he said.
The deal expands Syniverse's customer base and broadens its products offering, said analyst John Bright at Avondale Partners.
"This is going to strengthen their (Syniverse) competitive landscape against their No. 1 competitor in the messaging space which is Sybase Inc SY.N," said Sidoti & Co analyst Thomas Davey.
Two analysts said Sybase had also bid for Verisign's messaging business. Officials at Sybase and Verisign were not immediately available for comment.
For Verisign, which had been in talks to sell non-core units, the sale is expected to help it focus on its Internet security and domain name services business.
Syniverse shares were up 23 percent at $18.86 on the New York Stock Exchange in the afternoon trade, after climbing as much as 26.3 percent to their highest since last November.
