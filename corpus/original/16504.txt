(Reuters) - Jiangxi Copper Corp has launched an expansion project at its Dexing copper mine to increase copper output by nearly one third, the official Xinhua News Agency said on Tuesday.
Dexing copper mine, with an annual output of about 120,000 tonnes of copper ore, was expected to add another 41,000 tonnes of copper ore after the expansion is completed, the agency said.
The mine's daily ore processing capacity will increase to 130,000 tonnes, from 100,000 tonnes.
The project would help Jiangxi Copper, China's top integrated copper producer, make use of more than 700 million tonnes of low-grade ore and maintain a stable supply from the mine for an additional eight years, the agency quoted Liu Fangyun, head of the mine, as saying.
The company did not give details on when the project would be completed or the total investment, but the company's website carried a local newspaper report that said the investment was about 2.5 billion yuan ($365.8 million) (www.jxcc.com).
