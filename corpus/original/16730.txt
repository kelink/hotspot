(Reuters) - Global miner BHP Billiton (
) said on Friday they will combine their major Australian iron ore operations, threatening to kill off Rio's $19.5 billion deal with China's Chinalco.
) and Rio, the world's second and third largest iron ore miners, have agreed to combine the operations into a 50-50 joint venture, the companies said in a joint statement.
BHP will pay Rio Tinto $5.8 billion to take its equity interest in the venture to 50 percent, but it stressed that the agreement was non-binding at this stage.
The deal comes as Chinese state-owned Chinalco was poised to walk away from a $19.5 billion investment in Rio Tinto agreed in February, as the two wrangled over changes in the deal in the face of shareholder opposition. [ID:nSYD357712]
Rio's deal with BHP appears to destroy at least one major plank of the Chinalco deal, which included selling the Chinese a stake in the prized Hamersley iron ore mine.
Chinalco said on Friday it planned to make a statement on the proposed tie-up with Rio, although the timing would depend on a statement from Rio.
"Clearly Chinalco knows what's coming but obviously Rio must make an announcement before anything else," Chinalco spokesman Jim Kelly told Reuters.
"Rio Tinto is pursuing a range of options, some of which are at an advanced stage, for maximising shareholder value and improving the group's capital structure," it said.
