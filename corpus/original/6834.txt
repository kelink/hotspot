(Reuters) - The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) has completed draft rules governing the listing and trading of overseas-based companies, Chairman Geng Liang said on Monday, as China moves closer to the international board launch.
The draft rules are subject to change and public opinion will be sought in due course, but there's no official timetable for the launch of the new board, Geng told a news briefing on the sidelines of the National People's Congress in Beijing.
"The Shanghai Stock Exchange aims to become a market for both domestic and overseas blue-chips," Geng said. "The new board would also help Shanghai become an international financial center."
China plans to allow foreign companies to sell shares publicly in Shanghai as soon as this year, part of efforts to reregulate its capital markets and broaden investment channels for domestic investors.
Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies that are technically based overseas have also expressed an interest, including China Mobile (
Companies could list in Shanghai either through initial public offerings or in the form of China Depositary Receipts (CDRs), Geng said.
The SSE also plans to roll out cross-boarder exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this year, allowing Chinese investors to buy a basket of overseas-traded shares using the local currency, Geng said.
So far, 12 overseas bourses and fund companies have licensed their indexes to the Shanghai Stock Exchange, allowing the bourse to develop ETF products based on these gauges, he said.
The exchange will also boost the development of its bond market by introducing institutional investors and encouraging more companies to sell corporate debts, as it competes with China's interbank market, currently the dominant bond market.
Ten listed lenders have won approval to trade bonds on the SSE, Geng said.
