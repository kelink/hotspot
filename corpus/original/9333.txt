Gold investment demand rises, jewelry weak in Q3

(Reuters) - Demand from gold investment products and exchange traded funds grew in the third quarter despite weak jewelry demand, a report by World Gold Council showed.
Total volume of gold bullion bought via ETFs rose by 38.5 tonnes to a record 1,732.5 tonnes for the quarter, the industry-sponsored WGC said in an October report.
"We saw an improvement in risk appetite during the quarter, which also put more downward pressure on the dollar as investors sold U.S. Treasuries in favor of higher yielding assets overseas, further increasing demand for gold as a dollar hedge," said Natalie Dempster, WGC's head of investment, North America.
However, the WGC said preliminary reports showed that demand from India remained weak in the quarter, and the U.S. market was hurt by cutbacks in discretionary spending, in spite of more upbeat results from China.
Investors increased their holdings of gold futures during the quarter. Net long non-commercial positions on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, a proxy for investor flows, rose to an all-time high of 27.58 million ounces by the end of September.
Gold price volatility dropped during the quarter, and gold remained one of the least volatile commodities, the WGC said. (Reporting by Frank Tang; Editing by Walter Bagley)
