Crude slides on API oil data, demand concern

(Reuters) - U.S. crude oil futures fell more than 2 percent on Wednesday as an industry report of building crude oil inventories, disappointing durable goods data and a stronger dollar all helped pressure oil.
An equities drop in Shanghai also helped pressure crude, with China viewed as a key oil market.
The American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday said domestic crude inventories rose 4.1 million barrels last week as imports increased. Gasoline stocks dropped just 47,000 barrels and distillate stocks rose 116,000 barrels, the API said. <API/S>
The U.S. Energy Information Administration's supply report is set for release at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) on Wednesday.
Distillate stocks were expected to be up 1.3 million barrels and gasoline stocks up 400,000 barrels.
* On the New York Mercantile Exchange at 9:23 a.m. EDT (1323 GMT), September crude was down $1.64 cents, or 2.44 percent, at $65.59 a barrel, trading from $65.24 to $67.01.
* In London, September Brent crude fell $1.09, or 1.56 percent, to $68.79 a barrel, trading from $68.17 to $69.89.
* NYMEX August RBOB fell 1.94 cents, or 1.02 percent to $1.8912 a gallon, trading from $1.8841 to $1.9135.
* NYMEX August heating oil fell 2.07 cents, or 1.17 percent, to $1.7440 a gallon, trading from $1.7384 to $1.7655.

* The spread between the current front month and the five-year forward crude contract was at $20.34, based on the September 2014 contract Tuesday settlement at $85.93. The spread ended Tuesday at $18.70.
* New orders for U.S. durable manufactured goods fell more sharply than expected in June, notching their biggest decline in five months, the government reported.
* A late sell-off on Shanghai's stock market depressed emerging market stocks and took Asian shares off multi-month peaks, but the mood failed to carry over into Europe, where stocks rose sharply on corporate earnings.
