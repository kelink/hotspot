(Reuters) - U.S. pending home sales in April notched their biggest monthly gain in 7-1/2 years, a report showed on Tuesday, presenting evidence from a key sector of the U.S. economy that supports signs the global recession may be bottoming out.
Other U.S. industries, including the struggling auto and banking sectors, also reported upbeat news that added to the growing perception that the world's biggest economy may have put its worst days behind it.
Earlier, ministers from Japan and Germany said they saw signs of growth next year, while a global consumer survey found confidence stabilizing.
"The collapse of the housing market was the catalyst for the financial crisis," said William Hornbarger of Wachovia Securities in St. Louis, Missouri. "This stronger number will add to the increased optimism that is flowing through the stock markets at the moment."
