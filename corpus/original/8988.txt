(Reuters) - Japan's Sanyo Electric Co 6764.T said it will sell part of its battery operations to FDK Corp (
), a Fujitsu Ltd (
) unit, for 6.4 billion yen ($70 million) to satisfy antitrust regulators ahead of its planned takeover by Panasonic Corp (
Sanyo, the world's largest maker of rechargeable batteries, plans to sell its operations to make nickel-metal hydride batteries for consumer electronics and power tools to FDK, while keeping its auto-use nickel-metal hydride battery business.
Other businesses that will be sold to FDK, an electronic components maker, include parts of its operations for coin cell and cylindrical batteries, Sanyo said.
Panasonic said last December it would spend at least 400 billion yen to take control of Sanyo, creating a powerhouse in the fast-growing market for batteries for hybrid cars.
Sanyo will likely book a 9 billion yen loss for the deal, but said the negative impact has already been factored into its latest earnings outlook.
Following the comment by the source but prior to the official announcement, shares in Sanyo closed down 2.7 percent at 214 yen, underperforming the Tokyo stock market's electrical machinery index .IELEC.T, which lost 1.9 percent. (Reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka; Editing by Michael Watson)
