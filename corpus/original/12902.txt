* Strong bids for the record monthly amount of new seven-year issues on Thursday contrasted with disappointing demand at Tuesday's $42 billion two-year note sale and Wednesday's $39 billion five-year debt auction. For the week, the Treasury sold a record $115 billion in longer-dated Treasuries and $120 billion in bills.
* But analysts say the results of the seven-year auction may only be a blip, as the market will have to face a wave of supply this year amid concerns that global appetite for U.S. government debt could wane.
* "Traders have been paying attention to overseas demand, especially China's stance on Treasury buying," said a strategist at a Japanese securities firm. "Although the first two auctions this week were poor, it seemed that investors had waited for prices to dip," he said.
* Asian shares were higher with Tokyo's Nikkei stocks average
hitting a 10-month high and MSCI's broad measure of Asian stocks outside Japan rising 1.5 percent .MIAPJ0000PUS.
* The benchmark 10-year notes dipped 6/32 in price to yield 3.635 percent US10YT=RR, up about 2 basis points from late New York trade on Thursday.
* Two-year notes US2YT=RR edged down 1/32 in price to yield 1.204 percent, up 2 basis points. The 30-year bonds fell 13/32 in price to yield 4.435 percent US30YT=RR, up about 2 basis points.
