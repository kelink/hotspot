(Reuters) - Juvenile justice, Guantanamo prisoners and online copyright are among pending cases that the next member of the U.S. Supreme Court will confront if approved by the Senate.
President Barack Obama is expected soon to name his choice to fill a vacancy created by the retiring liberal Justice David Souter, and the new judge is expected to be in place when the nine-member court returns to work in October after its summer recess.
The Supreme Court decides contentious social issues, like abortion and use of race as a factor in hiring and promotions, criminal law cases on the death penalty and high-stakes disputes involving corporations.
For its coming term that begins in October, the court already has a number of issues on the agenda. They include:
The ruling could affect more than 2,500 individuals in the United States serving sentences of life imprisonment for crimes committed before they turned 18, human rights groups said.
The U.S. Justice Department defended the 1999 law that Congress adopted in an effort to crack down on videos like those depicting dog fights. It compared animal cruelty to child pornography, which the Supreme Court has said does not qualify for free-speech protection.
The writers sued the publishers and electronic database services, saying their contracts did not give the publishers the right to electronically reproduce their work or licence it for others to do so.
The case involved a challenge to a 2006 New Hampshire law that banned using information about a doctor's prescribing history for the purpose of increasing drug sales.
