(Reuters) - The U.S. dollar weakened broadly on Wednesday as investors expected the Federal Reserve will soon offer additional stimulus to the economy, while stocks and commodities recovered after China's surprise interest rate hike.
The dollar fell across the board after talk the U.S. central bank plans to spend $500 billion in bond purchases over the next six months, with an open-ended commitment to do more in the next 18 months. Medley Global Advisors, a consulting firm, described the Fed's plans in a report, a source told Reuters.
The prospect of an increase in dollar supply weakened the currency's value while it fueled a rally in equity markets. Such a development also will likely anger emerging economies contending with a flood of capital as investors chase higher yields.
The forex market is "in a bit of a gray area" that should persist at least through a weekend gathering of the G20 and the Fed's November meeting, Camilla Sutton, Scotia Capital currency strategist said. Fed officials are expected to announce plans to pump more money into the economy after their meeting.
"We think the dollar will end the year weaker, but for now, we're probably going to be in a period of more subdued trading until we get a firmer idea of where policymakers are headed," she said.
China triggered a global risk sell-off on Tuesday when it announced a hike in interest rates, the first in nearly three years.
The move stoked fears among investors about further tightening in one of the global economy's main drivers and coincided with an increase in tensions over global currency policies before a meeting of Group of 20 finance ministers this weekend.

Investors resumed selling the dollar against most currencies on Wednesday, rediscovering an appetite for higher-yielding assets.
The dollar was down against major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY off 1.15 percent at 77.288.

Merkel's remarks on exit strategies from loose monetary and fiscal policy echo similar comments from European Central Bank Governing Council member Axel Weber and contrast with expectations for more monetary easing from the Fed.
