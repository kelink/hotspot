(Reuters) - Syniverse Holdings Inc SVR.N posted a lower quarterly profit, hurt partly by lower revenue from its technology interoperability service, and tightened its full-year revenue outlook.
Shares of the Tampa, Florida-based company were down 6 percent at $16.21 in trading after the bell. They closed at $17.25 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
The company, which provides technology services to wireless telecommunications companies, earned $17.6 million, or 26 cents a share, compared with $25.5 million, or 37 cents a share, a year ago.
Excluding items, the company posted a cash net income of 41 cents a share.
Analysts were expecting 41 cents a share, excluding items, on revenue of $122.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Syniverse, whose customers include AT&T Inc (
), Telefonica (
), tightened its full-year revenue forecast to a range $466 million to $472 million from its previous projections of $460 million to $480 million.
Last quarter, it had warned that full-year revenue could be closer to the lower end of its forecast.
Last week, Syniverse acquired VeriSign Inc's (
) mobile messaging business. With the acquisition, Syniverse's messaging business will comprise about 30 percent of its revenue going forward, Chief Executive Tony Holcombe said in a statement. (Reporting by Manasi Phadke in Bangalore; Editing by Anil D'Silva)
