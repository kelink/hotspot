) will focus more on emerging markets, especially Russia and Brazil, to take advantage of long-term growth potential, its chief financial officer said on Tuesday.
Electrolux has the potential to expand further in countries outside its main European and U.S. markets, though these must remain the key focus, Jonas Samuelson said at an investor presentation.
"We are not fully represented in emerging markets and must focus on them," Samuelson said. "We are looking first at low hanging fruit."
In addition to Russia and Brazil, Samuelson also saw room for growth in Southeast Asia and Mexico, but was less optimistic about prospects in China.
"In time we'll have many clear growth opportunities, but the first priority will be to establish profitable activities in our core markets, and we will not lose that focus," Samuelson said.
Chief Executive Hans Straberg said the company was currently losing money in Germany, Spain and Britain.

It announced plant closures in Spain and the United States as part of its cost-cutting programme and said it would refocus the production of laundry products to Juarez, Mexico.
Despite upbeat earnings, both firms were cautious about their outlook for the next quarter as the effect of low commodity prices could begin to wear off, potentially raising costs.
Samuelson said Electrolux's cost-cutting programme would produce savings of 500 million Swedish crowns ($71 million) in 2010, and a further 600 million the following year. ($1=7.056 Swedish Crown) (Reporting by Victoria Klesty, writing by Nick Vinocur; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)
