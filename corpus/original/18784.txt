(Reuters) - Aussie bill futures fell on Wednesday after strong retail sales data doused hopes of monetary easing while Hong Kong interbank rates slumped to their lowest since January 2005 amid aggressive currency intervention.
In Australia, retail sales soared above market forecasts in March amid a consumer spending binge and it sparked concerns authorities may become more reluctant to cut interest rates in the near term. [ID:nSYD388705]
Sales at department stores climbed over 13 percent in March, while spending on clothes rose 6.4 percent and that on household goods 1.3 percent.
That dragged down bank bill futures <0#YIB:>. The June contract fell to a low of 97.09 before recovering to 97.115, still below the previous close of 97.12.
"Some strong numbers," said David de Garis, senior economist markets at NAB. "It adds to the evidence that fiscal policy and monetary policy is working in Australia, and the Reserve Bank can just sit back and wait for the time being."
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) skipped a chance to ease at its monthly meeting on Tuesday, having already slashed its cash rate by 425 basis points to a record low of 3.0 percent.
The Hong Kong dollar is pegged at 7.80 to the U.S. dollar but can trade between 7.75 and 7.85, level at which the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is usually obliged to intervene to keep the band intact.
The HKMA intervened four times in the foreign exchange market on Tuesday, selling a total of HK$11.238 billion ($1.45 billion) for U.S. dollars during Asia and New York trading hours as the local currency repeatedly hit its upper limit. [ID:nHKG185282]
The liquidity injection in the local market, dragged interbank rates lower.
Three-month HIBOR HKD3MD= was fixed at 0.72357 percent, falling 2 basis points from Tuesday, its lowest level since late January 2005.
"Some IPOs are pending and investors are still worried about the results of the U.S. banks' stress tests. In the near term, there could still be further capital inflow -- so we cannot rule out any further FX intervention," said Frances Cheung,fixed income strategist at Standard Chartered Bank.
"The impact is diminishing. HKMA can also issue additional bills to absorb the additional liquidity in the market -- it has the tools to manage the overall liquidity," she said.
Dollar funding rates also declined after the three-month dollar London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) was fixed 2 basis points lower at 0.986 percent USD3MDFSR= on Tuesday, the first time on record it has fallen below 1 percent.
Three-month dollar funding rates in Singapore SIUSDD=ABSG fell to 1.00043 percent from 1.012 percent. It is at its lowest since the June 2003 trough of 1 percent. (Reporting by Umesh Desai; Editing by Neil Fullick)
