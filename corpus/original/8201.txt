The U.S. unemployment rate jumped to a 26-1/2-year high of 10.2 percent last month. The Labor Department said employers cut 190,000 jobs in October.
Taking some of the sting out of the report, job losses for August and September were revised to show fewer jobs were lost than previously reported.
The Bank of New York Mellon index of leading Asian ADRs .BKAS shed 0.2 percent. In Asia, stocks rose on hopes of economic recovery, buoyed by oil prices that recovered to $80 a barrel.
The Bank of New York Mellon index of leading European ADRs .BKEUR was up 0.1 percent. In Europe, shares closed up for the third consecutive session with banking stocks the major gainers. The FTSEurofirst 300
index of top European shares closed up 0.2 percent at 992.53 points in a choppy session, having earlier been up as much as 995.78 points and down as low as 979.69 points.
