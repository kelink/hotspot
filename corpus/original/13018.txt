(Reuters) - The dollar trimmed gains against most other major currencies on Thursday after China's central bank said it will stick to a loose monetary policy to consolidate its economic recovery, easing market worries about its growth.
The yen fell broadly after the Chinese central bank's vice governor was reported as saying it will use market tools instead of quota-style controls to ensure credit growth is appropriate. [ID:nPEK348322]
But the dollar held firm against the euro near two-week highs as traders said investors booking profits from a recent rally in share prices before taking summer vacations was another reason behind Wednesday's sharp fall in Chinese stocks.
"I personally feel that the market will see further corrective moves before more clues emerge on how the economy will fare after this summer, with the dollar broadly rising and commodities falling," said Kosuke Hanao, head of treasury product sales for HSBC in Tokyo.
It slid as low as $1.4007 on trading platform EBS the day before, the lowest since July 15 after concerns about Chinese growth hurt commodity prices and hit U.S. stocks, sparking a rush to the safe-haven greenback.
Against the yen, the euro rose 0.2 percent to 133.75 yen, and the dollar rose 0.2 percent to 95.20 yen
, up 0.1 percent on the day. It had earlier fallen as low as $0.6477 on Reuters dealing system, below a near 10-month high of $0.6635 hit earlier this week.
Market reaction was muted to figures showing Japan's industrial output rose 2.4 percent in June, matching expectations and increasing for the fourth straight month. Manufacturers surveyed expect a further pickup in output towards August. [ID:nTKF106504] (Editing by Michael Watson)
