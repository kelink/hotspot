IEA concerned about rapid oil price rise: Tanaka

(Reuters) - The International Energy Agency is concerned about the rapid rise in oil prices, its executive director Nobuo Tanaka said on Wednesday, highlighting risks that a sharp increase could hurt the economic recovery.
Crude oil futures surged to a 2009 high above $75 a barrel on Wednesday, boosted by optimism about a global economic rebound.
"The rapid hike of the price is certainly a concern," Tanaka told reporters on the sidelines of the IEA's ministerial meeting, without expanding on the organization's concern.
"We have increased our predictions for demand... but data from the field is not that promising. We are watching carefully how the real economy is moving in OECD countries as well as emerging countries," he added.
The IEA, which advises 28 industrialized economies, said last week in a monthly report that it had increased its global oil demand growth estimate for 2010 to 1.42 million barrels per day, up 150,000 bpd from its previous projection.
Oil producer group OPEC also on Tuesday raised its forecasts for world demand, predicting an average 28.39 million bpd next year, up 300,000 bpd from its previous forecast.
"Spiking prices in oil and gas are very counter-productive because they can set off recessions... What we want is stable prices in oil and gas," Chu told reporters, adding a jump in oil did not necessarily foster the development of cleaner energies.
"The renewables can be encouraged in a number of ways but to wish that certain fossil fuels prices jump up is I think not correct," Chu added on the sidelines of the IEA meeting.
Chu and Tanaka both reiterated their hopes that December's global climate change meeting in Copenhagen would be successful despite a chorus of discord over the negotiations.
"We are working toward this. I remain hopeful," Chu said.
"Usually, the real outcome in negotiations comes out at the last minute, so we don't know. We feel this economic crisis provides a window of opportunity to move toward a successful conclusion in Copenhagen," he said.
"Luckily, the slowdown of economic activity created a drop in CO2 emissions which is the first time since World War II... So we are cautiously optimistic (for the summit's outcome)."
Negotiators from developed countries and emerging nations have been wrestling with whether to extend the Kyoto Protocol into a second commitment period from 2013, amend the pact, or create a new one, a step many developing states resist.
Kyoto obliges rich countries to make quantified commitments to cut emissions of greenhouse gases that are stoking global warming, while developing countries do not have to assume quantified emissions targets.
China, as both the world's biggest developing country and the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases from human activity, is at the heart of those disagreements.
Tanaka and Chu both said nuclear power was part of the solution in the world's fight against climate change.
Chu also said his country, which produces about half of its electricity from coal, was making progress with initiatives on carbon capture and storage (CSS).
The IEA said on Tuesday that the world would need to have 100 large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects by 2020, many of which in the developing world, to help fight climate change.
