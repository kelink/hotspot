Handelsblatt said there were also investors from China, Russia as well as a hedge fund interested in investing in Porsche, without citing sources.
Separately, German daily Financial Times Deutschland said some of the banks in a consortium that gave Porsche a 10.75 billion euro loan earlier this year are demanding that Porsche's owner families bolster the sportscar maker's finances by integrating separately owned, Austria-based wholesale company Porsche Holding GmbH into Porsche Automobil Holding SE.
Porsche, which owns 51 percent in Volkswagen, is seeking an outside investor after amassing 9 billion euros ($12.6 billion) in debt during a bungled attempt to dominate VW.
Porsche had earlier dismissed as unworkable any deal which involved a partial sale of its sports car business to VW, noting that it would trigger banks to recall immediately the syndicated loan they awarded Porsche in March.
