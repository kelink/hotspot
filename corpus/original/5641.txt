Dollar rallies, stocks slide on China rate move

(Reuters) - World stocks and commodity prices fell sharply on Tuesday after China, the engine of growth in an anemic global recovery, raised interest rates for the first time since 2007 to curb its booming economy.
Wall Street also was hit by fears that U.S. banks might be on the hook for billions of dollars in souring mortgage bonds, driving stocks to post their biggest loss in two months. The dollar rallied broadly on China's unexpected 25-basis-point rate increase, a move that could mark the start of a more aggressive phase of monetary tightening in the world's fastest-growing major economy.
Crude oil prices slid more than 4 percent, its biggest single-day percentage decline since February, while copper tumbled from 27-month highs and gold shed as much as 2.7 percent, set for its largest one-day drop since early July.
The People's Bank of China said it would lift its benchmark one-year lending and deposit rate, effective on Wednesday, in a move analysts said may suggest Beijing and Washington are working together to ease rising currency tensions.
The Australian dollar, which last week rose above parity with the U.S. currency for the first time since 1983, was hit hardest, slipping 1.5 percent. The euro and sterling also fell sharply.
Investors feared China's quarter-percentage point rise in interest rates could dampen Chinese and global growth while slowing China's voracious demand for commodities.
"China's rate increase instantaneously pushed people to take risk off the table," said Boris Schlossberg, director of research at GFT Forex.
China "is trying to clamp down on growth and that's going to reflect badly on Australia, on Germany, on much of the world economy as it readjusts to the idea that Chinese growth may not be as torrid as expected," Schlossberg said.
The dollar was up against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY up 1.66 percent at 78.206.
Trading in Tokyo was poised to open lower, with the December futures contract that trades in Chicago for the Nikkei 225 down 50 points at 9,495.
"It's reminding investors of what was the main impetus for the horrific sell-off we had a few years ago," said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management in Chicago. "If you were recently struck by lightning, you are a little skittish when there is a thunderstorm."
