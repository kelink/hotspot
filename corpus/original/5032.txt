Jodie Kelley, vice president and general counsel at the Business Software Alliance, said U.S. software companies like Microsoft and Oracle "at a minimum want to see a multi-year license agreement" rather than a one-time sale, however large.
Given the amount of lost sales, any agreement announced next week "would have to be pretty significant" to satisfy concerns U.S. software companies have, Kelley said.
Like many countries, China closed its door to U.S. beef exports after the first case of mad cow disease was found in the United States more than seven years ago.
Bill Westman, vice president for international trade at the American Meat Institute, said it was unclear whether the two sides would be able to strike a deal by next week.
But "having them go back to the table so soon after JCCT (U.S.-China Joint Commission and Commerce and Trade) meeting is encouraging," Westman said.
Since 2003, the United States has taken steps to ensure its beef supply is safe from disease, and many countries have either lifted or partially lifted their import bans.
