The United Nations said last week it was concerned about China's return of the nine to North Korea, where they face severe punishment, possibly execution, for having fled. The nine were first sent back to China after crossing into Laos.
Hundreds of North Koreans attempt to flee from their country every year, often first crossing into China and then making their way to Southeast Asia. Many end up at a reception center in Bangkok from where they are flown to South Korea.
But the North's KCNA news agency said South Korean "elements" had tried to trick the nine and take them to the South.
"Recently, a case of an unprecedented anti-humanitarian act of atrocity has been disclosed where traitorous puppet elements tried to trick and kidnap our youths and drag them to South Korea," the KCNA news agency said.
KCNA, quoting a spokesman for the North's Red Cross central committee, said the nine were forced to read Christian literature and had been given information critical of North Korean in an attempt to bring them to the South.
The South Korean government should "punish the instigators and apologize for the criminal act", KCNA said.
More than 20,000 North Korean defectors have made their way to South Korea, many via Southeast Asia, and many with the help of South Korean human rights groups, religious organizations or commercial brokers.
