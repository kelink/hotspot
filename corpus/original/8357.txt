Wang said he expected Juneyao Air to book between 50 million yuan to 60 million yuan in profit this year, up sharply from roughly 10 million yuan in 2008, but did not specify whether it was net profit or operating profit.

"We will not rush into long-haul international routes in a hurry. We will go step by step," he said. ($1=6.826 Yuan) (Reporting by Fang Yan and Jacqueline Wong)
