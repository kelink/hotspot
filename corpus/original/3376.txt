(Reuters) - China's securities regulator will review New China Life Insurance's plan for the Shanghai leg of its Shanghai-Hong Kong dual listing on November 16, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday.
New China Life, the country's third-biggest life insurer in which Swiss insurer Zurich Financial (
) holds a stake, will release its draft prospectus on the website of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) later on Friday, one of the sources said.
New China Life aims to raise about 6 billion yuan ($945 million) in Shanghai and 10 billion yuan in Hong Kong, the other source said.
Companies in Greater China are lining up to sell shares in initial public offerings in coming months, braving jittery markets with deals worth more than $10 billion in total, as they take advantage of the steep market rebound in the past month.
China Railway Materials Commercial Corp., Sinochem Corp. and Jiangsu Phoenix Media & Publishing Corp Ltd unveiled plans over the past few days to raise about $8.2 billion in IPOs in Shanghai. In Hong Kong, Chow Tai Fook Jewellery received the go-ahead from the exchange for its offering, valued at up to $3 billion.
Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index
has surged nearly 18 percent since October 4, while the Shanghai Composite Index
is up about 6 percent, compared with a 2.8 percent gain in the MSCI World index.
New China Life has lined up a number of cornerstone investors for the deal and was planning to start premarketing the deal once regulatory approvals were granted, IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication reported last month.
