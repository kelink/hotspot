* GM/UAW executives expected in Washington (Adds UAW email, Washington negotiations)
) and the United Auto Workers union to reach agreements on all aspects of the automaker's restructuring plan, including production issues, a U.S. Treasury spokeswoman said on Monday.
The UAW has been campaigning to block GM's restructuring plan on the grounds that it would close 16 plants and cut some 21,000 domestic factory jobs while increasing imports of GM-badged vehicles from China, Mexico and South Korea.
"GM and the UAW are in active and constructive deliberations around all aspects of their plan," the spokeswoman said.
GM's production plan "is one of several issues they are focused on, and the (Obama) administration is supportive of their efforts to come to a resolution," the official said.
In an e-mail to rank-and-file workers late on Sunday, the union's leadership said it expected talks to intensify this week, with both Ron Gettelfinger, the union's president, and GM Chief Executive Fritz Henderson due in Washington.
UAW leaders also urged auto workers and retirees to write to President Barack Obama and ask him to dictate job-saving changes to the plan proposed by GM, which faces a June 1 government deadline to show it can be viable or face probable bankruptcy. The union made a similar appeal to Congress last week. (Reporting by David Lawder and John Crawley; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
