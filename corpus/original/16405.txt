(Reuters) - Japan's target to cut emissions by 15 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 is not close to what is required for rich countries to take their responsbility for climate change, China's climate ambassador Yu Qingtai said.
Yu was speaking on Wednesday on the sidelines of U.N.-led, June -1-12 climate talks in Bonn, Germany involving 181 countries, meant to culminate in agreement on a new global climate pact in Copenhagen in December.
"In our view it would be much below what Japan as an annex one country would need to do to meet its obligations," Yu told Reuters, reacting to Japan's new 2020 target.
Japan would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent by 2020 from 2005 levels, Prime Minister Taro Aso said on Wednesday. [ID:nTKU105408]
"I do not believe it is a number that is close to what Japan needs to do, should do," said Yu.
