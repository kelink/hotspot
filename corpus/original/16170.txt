Here are key facts about the border area, known as the Wakhan Corridor.
* The Wakhan Corridor extends in a panhandle in Afghanistan's northeastern Badakhshan province up to the relatively small border with China's Xinjiang province. The corridor is roughly 210 km long (130 miles) long and between 20 km and 60 km wide. Tajikistan lies to the north and Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province and disputed Jammu and Kashmir lie to the south. The border at the eastern end in the Hindu Kush is one of the highest in the world at 4,293 metres.
* The corridor is populated primarily by Wakhi farmers and yurt-dwelling Kyrghyz herders, with the agricultural economy dominated by subsistence farming. The population has been estimated at about 10,600. People in the corridor suffer from a range of problems including poverty, ill health, lack of education, food insecurity and opium addiction, according to a United Nations Environment Programme and Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2003.
* The mountainous, sparsely populated Wakhan Corridor is the primary habitat in Afghanistan for snow leopards, which are listed as endangered or threatened under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. It is estimated there are only between 100 and 200 snow leopards left in Afghanistan, about the same number as in Bhutan, and a complete hunting ban has been in place since 2002. The Wakhan Corridor is also home to wild Marco Polo sheep.
