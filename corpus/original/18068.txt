(Reuters) - Standard & Poor's cut China's Mandra Forestry to its lowest rating, after the operator of commercial forestry plantations became the latest Asian issuer to miss an interest payment on its foreign-denominated bonds.
S&P's downgrade on Monday by two notches to 'D' from 'CC' comes after Mandra missed an interest payment due Friday on its $195 million senior bonds maturing in 2013 562670AA7=.
"Standard & Poor's views Mandra as being in material financial distress," said credit analyst Ryan Tsang of the agency.
The action marks S&P's third downgrade of Mandra since June 2008, when the company had been affirmed at a 'B-minus' rating.
Early this month, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Mandra Forestry by three notches to 'Ca,' or its second-lowest rating following the company's warning.
Asian companies have suffered a raft of negative credit actions this year as the global economic slowdown pressures the financial health of companies in the region, especially smaller companies with reduced access to funding.
