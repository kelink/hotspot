(Reuters) - Contingency measures, or legal "safety valves," allowing countries to suspend or waive trade commitments, can damage the global economy if abused for protectionist purposes, the World Trade Organization said on Wednesday.
Safeguards allow policy-makers to agree to higher levels of commitments than without such flexibility, because they will allow them to react to unforeseen economic events.
Typically sought by companies suffering from cheap imports, and targets companies in the exporting country.
Under WTO rules should not penalize the exporter, simply even out the prices.
Imposed by countries to compensate for subsidies in another country. Unlike antidumping, it targets a foreign government, not foreign companies.
Some countries may prefer to renegotiate their trade commitments if they have a problem with imports in a particular sector, any pay compensation -- typically agreeing concessions in another area.
WTO members typically negotiate maximum levels, or ceiling, for tariffs. They retain the right to apply tariffs below the level of these bound rates, moving them up and down as the economy requires.
For instance a country may cut tariffs on grain to let in food if there is a food shortage, then raise them again to the agreed bound rate when local farmers can supply the market.
Allow countries to provide industry with a cheap source of raw materials, or consumers with plentiful supplies of goods such as food in a shortage.
