) said on Tuesday it was seeking "aggressive" double-digit percentage cuts in its cost structure in China in 2009, coming after the company reported a steep drop in global earnings.
"I'm certainly glad I'm in China," John Watkins, the chief executive of Cummins (China) Investment Co, told Reuters in an interview.
Watkins said the company's focus in the past 10 years was on satisfying soaring customer demand, but with the onset of slowing growth around the world it was time to shift the focus to cost cutting and improving efficiency.
"We are much more focused on costs now," he said. "They are double digit and they are aggressive," he said, referring to the cost cutting targets for China.
And while Cummins had identified several areas where waste could be eliminated and more efficiency achieved, it was not resorting to layoffs to meet its cost cutting target, said Watkins, who is also a vice president of the parent company.
While the company would post a fall in sales in China this year, the decline would be much smaller than company will suffer globally, he said.
In fact, China sales as a percent of total revenues will rise from the 12 percent in 2008 to a high teens percentage this year, he said.
To support that growth, the company will open four factories this year in China, one of which will become its largest in the world when it reaches capacity of 400,000 engines annually.
Cummins has spent a total of $300 million in China, establishing 26 legal entities, ten of which are joint ventures.
