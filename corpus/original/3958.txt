(Reuters) - State-owned People's Insurance Company of China Group (PICC), one of the country's largest insurers, plans to raise $5 billion to $6 billion in an initial public offering in Hong Kong and Shanghai, IFR reported citing two sources with knowledge of the plans.

PICC's offering comes amid an expected flurry of activity in the financial services industry over the coming months as companies look to raise funds to bolster their balance sheets.

"The earnings outlook for the insurance industry is pretty good for this year," he said.
Chinese insurance firms saw their total profits rise 72.3 percent to a collective 49 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) in the first half of the year from the same period last year, data from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission showed.
