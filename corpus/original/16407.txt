(Reuters) - Japan's reported plan on Wednesday to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 8 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 narrows overall cuts planned by industrialised nations to about 10 to 14 percent, Reuters calculations show.
The figures are far short of calls by developing nations for richer nations to make deep reductions in emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels, as part of a new U.N. treaty due to be agreed in Copenhagen in December.
Kyodo news agency said Prime Minister Taro Aso would announce a cut of 8 percent later on Wednesday. The world's number five emitter, Japan has been considering options ranging from a rise of 4 percent to a cut of 25 percent from 1990. [ID:nT183553]
Under those broad Japanese options, aggregate cuts outlined so far by rich western nations and those of the former Soviet bloc had ranged from 9 to 16 percent.
INDUSTRIALISED NATIONS' PLANS FOR CUTS (PERCENT):
13,843-13,142 15,336
(NOTES: Based on Reuters calculations from submissions to U.N. Climate Change Secretariat. Goals range from approved plans to options under consideration -- U.S. goal is President Obama's target of returning emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Some countries, notably Russia, have not yet outlined plans)
DEVELOPING NATIONS' DEMANDS OF THE RICH BY 2020:
China, India, many other developing nations want at least 40 percent below 1990. A group of 43 small island states want at least 45 percent below 1990.
A 2007 report said industrialised nations as a group would have to reduce their emissions by between 25 and 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 to avoid the worst of global warming such as droughts, floods, heatwaves and rising sea levels.
It also said developing nations should slow their rising emissions with a "substantial deviation" below projected growth rates by 2020. The European Union, for instance, wants them to cut by 15-30 percent below projected growth rates.
More than 180 nations are meeting in Bonn, Germany, from June 1-12 to debate a new U.N. treaty to succeed the U.N.'s Kyoto Protocol. The new pact is due to be agreed in Copenhagen in December.
