(Reuters) - Maria Sharapova kept alive her French Open dream on Sunday when the Russian reached the quarter-finals with a 6-4 0-6 6-4 victory over China's Li Na.
The former world number one, who is on a comeback trail following a nine-month injury layoff, will meet Slovak 20th seed Dominika Cibulkova for a place in the last four.
Sharapova, who has dropped to 102nd in the WTA rankings and has needed three sets to advance from each round, dropped serve twice but broke three times to take the opening set before fading away in the second.
"Whatever it takes. Two sets, three sets, two sets and five hours," Sharapova told a news conference.
"The thigh was just a little sore. It will be okay, we have a day off in the grand slams, so it will be fine," she said.
The Russian's mental strength had made the difference, her opponent said.
"She's strong, so strong mentally. She was always fighting, doesn't matter what the score was," Li, who had been the last Asian player left in either of the singles draws, told reporters.
