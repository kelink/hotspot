(Reuters) - Houston Rockets' Chinese center Yao Ming is to undergo surgery on his foot injury and has been ruled out for the whole of next season.
"While no timetable has been set for his return to action, Yao is expected to be available for the team's training camp in 2010," said the report
Last month the Rockets physician Tom Clanton described the injury to China's most famous sports personality as "career threatening."
The team said that surgery will involve a bone graft in the navicular bone of Yao's left foot in order to promote bone regeneration and there will also be treatment designed to reduce the arch in his left foot by realigning and restructuring the bones in the foot.
"This combination of procedures should not only allow healing of his navicular stress fracture, but also improve the mechanics of his foot to reduce the stress on that bone and give him the best long-term prognosis," said Clanton.
