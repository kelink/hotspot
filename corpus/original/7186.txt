(Reuters) - Chinese commercial banks' non-performing loans fell by 62.98 billion yuan to 497.33 billion yuan ($72.85 billion) in 2009, the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) said in a statement on Friday.
Non-performing loans represented 1.58 percent of the banks' loan books, down 0.84 percentage points from the start of the year, while provision cover was 155.02 percent, up 38.57 percentage points.
Ratings agency Fitch, affirming its "A+" long-term currency rating on China, said on Thursday that it was concerned about "an eventual deterioration in banks' asset quality" after the surge in lending.
"In the agency's view, falling non-performing loans do not indicate that banks' asset quality is improving, as some new loans have been used to roll over delinquent obligations, and the predominance of bullet-oriented repayment structures means that any problems associated with recent lending are unlikely to be evident until the loans mature," Fitch said.
Standard & Poor's on Tuesday also reaffirmed its "A+" long-term credit rating on China, citing its external assets, robust growth and small pile of debt.
