(Reuters) - China could damage the delicate stabilisation in the steel market by ramping up its exports even more, the chief executive of Austrian steelmaker Voestalpine (
"Overall the order intake has stabilised. There is a slight upward trend, we are at full capacity," Voestalpine CEO Wolfgang Eder said, speaking at a trade fair for retail investors.
"(But) overall it is on very, very thin ice. We fear that there will be huge exports out of China in the first half of the year," Eder said.
This could hurt the overall steel market and Voestalpine's business in its fiscal fourth quarter to March, said Eder, who is also President of the European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries (Eurofer).
Voestalpine shares widened losses after his comments and traded 3 percent lower at 24.90 euros by 1050 GMT, making them one of the weakest performers in the DJ Stoxx Basic Resources index .SXPP which was down 1.8 percent.
Voestalpine suffered weak demand in nearly all markets and industries in its first quarter to June, with commercial vehicle, machinery manufacturing and construction sectors badly hit. It reports second-quarter earnings Nov. 19.
But Eder said on Thursday he expects profits in the group's stainless steel division in the coming quarters. He added that he was sticking to the target of a 4 percent dividend yield but said he could not make any promises for this year. (Writing by Sylvia Westall; Editing by David Cowell)
