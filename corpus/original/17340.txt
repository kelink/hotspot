GM bankruptcy near as bond swap fails, no Opel deal

(Reuters) - General Motors Corp moved closer to filing the largest bankruptcy ever for a U.S. industrial company after a crucial bond exchange proposal failed, while the fate of GM's European brand Opel remained uncertain after marathon talks with German officials ended without a deal.
At the same time, bankrupt U.S. automaker Chrysler faced a key court hearing expected to clear the way for Fiat SpA to take control of its best assets on the fast-track schedule set by President Barack Obama's administration.
Less than a month after it filed Chapter 11, Chrysler is seeking approval to sell its stronger operations to a "New Chrysler" owned by Fiat, labor unions and the U.S. and Canadian governments, in exchange for $2 billion paid to lenders.
With the Chrysler case nearing conclusion, attention was shifting to the complications expected from GM's bankruptcy -- expected within the next few days -- and the sale of Opel.
Fiat is also in the race to win control of Opel, part of Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne's ambitious attempt to build an automotive alliance that could rank as the world's second-largest by sales behind Japan's Toyota Motor Corp.
The bidding battle for Opel had narrowed to a two-way race between Fiat and Canadian auto parts company Magna International Inc, German ministers said after more than 12 hours of talks stretching well into Thursday morning.
Belgium-listed holding RHJ International SA and China's Beijing Automotive Industry Corp had also submitted bids.
"We have made demands on the U.S. Treasury and expect answers by Friday and we will need these answers in order to agree a plan," Economy Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg said. "We don't have the security yet that we need to commit to bridge financing today."
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck spoke of "surprises and disappointment" with the U.S. negotiators, saying GM had shocked participants by announcing it needed 300 million euros ($415 million) more in short-term cash.
The exchange had been seen as GM's last hope to cut debt outside the kind of bankruptcy that has been under way for Chrysler since the end of April.
GM's board was expected to meet this week to consider the dwindling options available after the bond swap failed.
"Even with a ... favorable reaction from the bondholders, they were going to end up in bankruptcy," said George Magliano, forecasting director at auto industry tracking firm IHS Global Insight.
About 90,000 of GM's U.S. employees were paid three days early this week, an effort to reassure them that wages would not be affected by any bankruptcy filing, a GM spokesman said.
The company also aimed to continue production during any bankruptcy, purchasing chief Bob Andersson said, and was aiming to reduce the number of its parts suppliers to about 1,100 from 1,500 over the next year and a half.
Under its pending restructuring, GM will be majority-owned by the U.S. government, an effective nationalization intended to save jobs and prevent a more costly liquidation.
But Maryann Keller, an independent industry analyst, said action by the Obama administration, coupled with similar support for Opel in Europe, would prevent the global auto industry from undergoing a much needed shakeout of capacity.
"The major problem in this is that because of the action of government we're not going to see the strong survive and the weak dying," she said.
GM shares, which could be worthless if the automaker files for bankruptcy, fell 29 cents, or 20 percent, to $1.15 on Wednesday. The shares have traded in a 52-week range of $18.18 to $1.00.
In 2000, shortly after former CEO Rick Wagoner took over, GM shares peaked at $75. At that time, the automaker employed more than 146,000 factory workers.
Under a concessionary UAW contract workers are voting on through Thursday, GM's factory payroll could drop to near 33,000 workers.
