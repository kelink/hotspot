(Reuters) - China Unicom (
) on Tuesday said it expects average revenue per user per month for its mobile and broadband services to drop in the second half, but hopes income from its 3G data services will offset part of the decline.
Unicom, which lags industry leader China Mobile (
) by subscribers, recently reported a net profit for the first quarter of 3.57 billion yuan ($522.8 million), on total revenue of 37.92 billion yuan.
ARPU figures for the first quarter were not immediately available but the average for 2008 stood at 42.3 yuan, down from 45.7 yuan in 2007.
"Although ARPU is expected to decline, I still hope that the launch of 3G services will bring in more income from data services," Chairman Chang Xiaobing told reporters after the company's annual general meeting. He did not give a timeframe to stabilise ARPU.
The mobile carrier had 138.83 million total mobile subscribers as of April, up from 137.69 million in March.
Unicom, which holds the sole licence to operate WCDMA technology in China, officially launched third-generation mobile services on May 17.
"We all need to adjust the way we do things from how we did them in the past. Operators are more rational now," he said.
China Telecom plans to roll out its own 3G services next month, and aims to introduce 10 new 3G EVDO (evolution data optimised) phone handsets each month from June to August.
Unicom was studying opportunities for mergers and acquisitions but did not have any concrete plans or targets so far, Chang said.
Chang said he hoped Unicom would introduce Apple's iPhone to China, but added that an agreement had not yet been reached with Apple APPL.O.
"The limited potential upside and lack of impending positive catalysts prompt us to downgrade our investment rating from 'buy' to 'neutral', Nomura Securities Research analysts said in a note.
China Telecom shares ended up 0.87 percent at HK$3.48, while the benchmark Hang Seng index finished down 0.76 percent at 16,991.56. ($1=HK$7.75=6.832 Yuan) (Reporting by Joanne Chiu, writing by Nerilyn Tenorio, Editing by Ken Wills, Chris Lewis)
