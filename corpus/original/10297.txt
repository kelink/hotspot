METALS-Copper jumps to 3-week high on weak dollar, Alcoa
2009-10-08 15:09:00.0
(Reuters) - Copper rallied to a three-week high on Thursday, while zinc hit a 15-month peak as extended losses in the dollar and improved U.S data and strong earnings from Alcoa renewed bets for an economic recovery.
Copper for December delivery HGZ9 surged 11.90 cents, or 4.3 percent, to settle at $2.8985 a lb on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division, close to its session high at $2.9010 -- its loftiest level since Sept. 18.
On the London Metal Exchange (LME), copper for three-months delivery MCU3 rose $235 to end at $6,330 a tonne, after hitting a peak at $6,363, another high dating back to Sept. 18.
"The dollar is a big factor, but also the economic news early in terms of Alcoa's numbers coming in better and showing some revival in sales is certainly helping," said Steve Platt, futures analyst with Archer Financial Services in Chicago.

The news helped boost aluminum MAL3 more than 4 percent to a two-week high of $1,925 a tonne. Aluminum finished the session up $64 at $1,909. "The market was surprised by Alcoa's results but if you want a clear statement look to the dollar... it's terribly weak and everything is responding accordingly," said Gary Mead, senior commodities analyst at Virtual Metals. The dollar, perceived as a safe haven, fell broadly as rising equity markets fueled demand for riskier assets. A weak dollar makes dollar-priced metals cheaper for non-U.S. investors.

A separate report showed U.S retailers posted their first monthly sales rise in more than a year. [ID:nN08520274] In other metals, zinc MZN3 closed up $145 at $2,080 a tonne, after rallying more than 8 percent to a near 15-month high of $2,100. "The closure of Minmetal's Century zinc operation, following a leak in the pipeline transporting concentrate from the mine is continuing to lend support to prices," said Standard Bank in a note. Elsewhere, supply fears boosted sentiment in copper. Macqaurie Bank said earlier this session the world copper market stands to lose 50,000 tonnes of supply this year and tip back into deficit after a mechanical failure at Australia's giant Olympic Dam mine cut production capacity by 80 percent. [ID:nSYD432722] NERVES LINGER Prices of copper, used in power and construction, have doubled in value this year on the back of improved macro-economic data and restocking by China, the world's top consumer of the metal. But investors are still nervous about the demand picture as the outlook for global economic recovery remains uncertain, Chinese buying wanes and other global economies struggle to pick up the demand slack. Traders are gearing up for the return of Chinese markets on Friday after week-long National Day celebrations, and for the start of LME week on Monday, which will likely set the tone for the metals market outlook for next year. Battery material lead MPB3 ended at $2,080 from $2,155, having earlier jumped more than 4 percent to a two-week high of $2,274.75. Tin MSN3 was last bid at $14,945 from $14,675 and nickel MNI3 closed at $19,495 from $18,600. Nickel touched $19,500 earlier, its highest since late August.
