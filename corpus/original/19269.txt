Oil rises on hopes recession easing

(Reuters) - Oil prices climbed toward $51 per barrel on Wednesday as optimism that the U.S. recession was easing boosted markets and raised expectations of a rebound in energy demand from the world's largest consumer.
A U.S. government report showing a sharp decline in gasoline stockpiles last week added to oil's gains, sparking concern that inventories could be tight once peak summer driving demand kicks in.
tied to hopes the recession may be abating, even as a report showed a dismal 6.1 percent contraction in the U.S. economy in the first three months of the year.
"I think the gasoline draw is what caught everybody's eye. Nobody expected a draw of that magnitude," said Addison Armstrong, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
The EIA's weekly report also showed a 4.1-million-barrel increase in crude oil stockpiles last week, bringing inventories to a fresh 19-year high.
The gradual global spread of swine flu, with the first U.S. death confirmed from the H1N1 strain, also failed to dent the oil market Wednesday -- though prices for jet fuel were generally lower on concerns about the impact the health emergency would have on air travel.
"We have had a high correlation between stock markets and oil over the last few weeks and when equities go up, so do oil and other commodities," said Frank Schallenberger, head of commodities research at Landesbank in Stuttgart.
"It will take time for the economy to recover, and hence the oil and gas price will be affected by that," Voser said.
A Reuters' poll of 11 analysts, banks and industry groups forecast world oil demand would fall this year by much more than previously expected, as growth stalls in emerging powerhouses China and India and fuel consumption declines in the developed world.
