(Reuters) - Jamaican triple Olympic and world champion Usain Bolt will return to China next month for a 100 meters race in Shanghai, his agent said on Tuesday.
The September 20 race will be Bolt's first in Asia since his triumphant Beijing Olympics, Ricky Simms told Reuters in a telephone interview.
The 23-year-old also is considering a sprint race on September 25 in Daegu, South Korea. The city will host the next world athletics championships in 2011.
A book deal on Bolt's dramatic rise to become the world's top sprinter also is being finalized, Simms said.
"We have been in negotiations for a long time and I think it is almost coming to a conclusion," the agent said.
Still under discussion is the focus of the book. It could encompass Bolt's entire life or just his success in recent years.
"There may be a couple of books," Simms said.
Bolt will complete his European season with races in Zurich and Brussels in the coming days. He will face countryman and former world record holder Asafa Powell over 100 meters in Zurich Friday. The distance remains to determined for his race on September 4 in Brussels, where is scheduled to meet American Tyson Gay, Simms said.
