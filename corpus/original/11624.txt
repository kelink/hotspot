CNOOC's Huizhou plant to run at 80-90 pct capacity

(Reuters) - CNOOC's first major refinery in southern China, the Huizhou plant, will run at 80 to 90 percent of its 240,000 barrel per day capacity for the rest of the year, following its start-up in mid-March, company sources said.
The rate, steady from levels in July and August, is slightly below average operational rates of major plants run by China's top two refiners, but is considered high for a new plant in its first year of production, the sources said.
"We will try occasionally to push the runs to full rates but overall 80 to 90 percent is a safe bet," said one refining official with CNOOC, parent of listed CNOOC Ltd (
Rising domestic refined fuel stocks in recent months amid record crude imports and refinery output, is another reason to keep the Huizhou plant running at below full rates, a second company official said.
The plant in Huizhou city of Guangdong province is designed to process heavy, acidic but low-sulphur crude from CNOOC's offshore oilfields in the Bohai Bay off north China, but it is now taking in an average of between a third to half its throughput from imports, bigger than planned, they said.
That is because the crude production at CNOOC's flagship field Penglai 19-3 in Bohai Bay, operated by ConocoPhillips (
), rose slower than earlier expected, the officials said.
The field, the main one supplying the Huizhou plant and estimated to peak at nearly 190,000-bpd, is now pumping at about 90,000 bpd, the second official said.
ConocoPhillips announced in May the start-up of a 190,000-bpd floating, production and storage facility (FPSO), the largest of its kind in China, but did not give an output figure. (Reporting by Chen Aizhu; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
