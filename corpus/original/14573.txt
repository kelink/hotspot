(Reuters) - Chinese President Hu Jintao is flying back to Beijing following rioting in a northwestern region of China and will miss this week's G8 summit hosted by Italy, Italian news agency Ansa said on Wednesday.
Bloody ethnic clashes in the capital of Xinjiang earlier this week killed 156 people and wounded more than 1,000.
The G8 summit is due to open in the central Italian city of L'Aquila later on Wednesday and Hu had been scheduled to join the talks on Thursday. Ansa said a Chinese delegation would nonetheless remain in Italy and attend the meeting.
Xinjiang has long been a hotbed of ethnic tensions, fostered by a yawning economic gap between Uighurs and Han Chinese, government controls on religion and culture and an influx of Han Chinese migrants who are now in the majority in most key cities.
