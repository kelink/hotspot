China must lead on North Korea: State Department's Steinberg

(Reuters) - China should play a strong role in making clear to North Korea that there are consequences for its actions as the international community seeks to calm tensions on the Korean peninsula, a top U.S. State Department official said on Tuesday.
The U.S.-Chinese relationship has hit choppy waters in recent months over both economic issues and the brewing crisis over North Korea, which has stonewalled calls to dismantle its nuclear program and last month launched an artillery attack on a South Korean island, killing four people.
"It is critically important that China continue to play a strong role (in) making clear to North Korea that there are consequences for its actions," Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg said in a speech.
Steinberg, the No. 2 official in the State Department, also said the United States hoped China could spur domestic demand, adding that better balanced U.S.-Chinese economic ties could benefit both countries.
"We hope that in increasing domestic consumption, China can become a catalyst for growth," Steinberg said.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday held meetings with her Japanese and South Korean counterparts. All three called on China -- Pyongyang's main diplomatic ally -- to do more to rein in North Korea.
China has hit back at what it called an "irresponsible accusation" from the United States and its allies, saying they should accept Beijing's proposal for emergency talks on the situation.
The United States and its allies are lukewarm to this idea, believing that entering into talks would simply reward North Korea for its belligerent behavior.
