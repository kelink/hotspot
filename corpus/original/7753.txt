(Reuters) - Sino-American Silicon Products Inc, Taiwan's top maker of wafers for solar cells, expects shipments to rise about 30 percent in 2010, as the global market for solar power improves.
Sino-American, which supplies solar wafers to Japan's Sharp Corp and Sanyo Electric Co, also expects to raise cash by issuing shares and sees improved profitability next year on strong demand for solar products, Sino-American president Doris Hsu told Reuters.
"Next year, overall profitability will be much better than 2009," Hsu said in a telephone interview from Taiwan.
The company is targeting wafer shipments of nearly 400 megawatts in 2010, up from about 280 MW this year.
"The demand will be stronger in 2010," said Hsu, adding improved wafer prices and lower raw material costs should help boost profitability.
Wafer prices have collapsed to about $0.80 a watt now, from over $3 in 2008.
Sino-American, however, is gearing up for a bigger slice of a growing global market for solar in China and the U.S., where there are generous incentives for solar projects.
Sino-American, through its U.S. unit, GlobiTech, plans to venture into solar panel-making business by establishing a 100 MW solar module facility in the next two years.
"The plan is to grow GlobiTech organically, and eventually list the company on the Nasdaq within the next three years."
Sino-American, which derives nearly 30 percent of its revenue from its semiconductor business, also plans to acquire a semiconductor company in Japan to boost its capacity and is eyeing another solar company in China.
"We have yet to decide on the size and timing of the share issue, but that's the plan," said Hsu.
