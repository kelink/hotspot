(Reuters) - China and Russia once again lead the list of countries with the worst record on preventing piracy and counterfeiting of U.S. goods, the U.S. Trade Representatives office said on Thursday.
In addition, USTR said it was putting Canada on the "priority watch list" for first time because of increasing concern about the need to Canada to reform its copyright laws and to strengthen border enforcement.
"In this time of economic uncertainty, we need to redouble our efforts to work with all of our trading partners -- even our closest allies and neighbors such as Canada -- to enhance protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights," U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said in a statement.
"I'm particularly troubled by reports that Chinese officials are urging more lenient enforcement of IPR laws, motivated by the financial crisis and the need to maintain jobs," Kirk said.
"China needs to strengthen its approach to IPR protection and enforcement, not weaken it," Kirk said.
It said it was removing South Korea from a lower level "watch list" because of progress that government has made. (Reporting by Doug Palmer; editing by David Storey)
