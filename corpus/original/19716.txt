(Reuters) - Randstad NV (
) is expected to post a second consecutive quarterly loss on Friday, when investors in the Dutch staffing company will be looking at margin management and the outlook.

Randstad targets an annualised 4 percent margin on earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) in a normal downturn. "Obviously this is a far from normal downturn," finance director Robert-Jan van de Kraats said in February.
Randstad announced in January it would cut 489 jobs in France, generating 25 million euros in savings, and, in February, said it planned further restructuring measures without saying how many additional jobs might be cut.
On Tuesday, USG People (
), the Netherlands' second staffing company, said it saw a slowdown in the contraction of the economy in the United States and China, where it expects the first signs of recovery.
"As an early cycle staffing company (Randstad) would recover four months ahead of the trough ... at the beginning of the second quarter," ING analyst Marc Zwartsenburg said in a note.

Sales in the Dutch staffing market have been recording double-digit year-on-year declines this year, according to Dutch staffing association ABU.
