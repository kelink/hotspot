(Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries climbed in Asia on Friday as fears resurfaced about a likely clampdown on China's easy monetary policy and dented regional shares, pushing the benchmark 10-year yield to its lowest in more than a month.
Treasury note futures hit a more than one-month high after reports saying China's banking regulator may tighten capital rules by excluding the subordinated bonds which banks sell to other lenders from their capital base, triggering selling in U.S. stock futures.
The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) issued a document to lenders seeking feedback on such a move, banking sources close to the regulator told Reuters early in August. [ID:nSP529534]
But concerns that the Chinese economy, one of the biggest engines of the world economy, may lose steam made investors nervous and kept the appeal of U.S. Treasuries intact, analysts said.
"Many markets including interest rates and currencies reacted to the reports even before Shanghai stocks did," said a senior market analyst for a Japanese bank.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose 9/32 in price to yield 3.402 percent US10YT=RR, down 3 basis points from late U.S. trade on Thursday. It fell as low as 3.374 percent, the lowest since July 14, according to Reuters data.
Ten-year Treasury note futures climbed 7/32 to 118-10.5/32 TYv1 after reaching as high as 118-18.5/32, the highest since July 13.
The 30-year bonds climbed 16/32 in price to yield 4.217 percent US10YT=RR, down about 3 basis points. Two-year notes were unchanged in price to yield 0.988 percent US2YT=RR. (Editing by Michael Watson)
