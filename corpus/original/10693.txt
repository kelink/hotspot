(Reuters) - Former world number one Maria Sharapova ground out a 6-3 2-6 6-4 win over Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska to reach the Pan Pacific Open final Friday.
The Russian will play Serbia's Jelena Jankovic in the final after the seventh seed overpowered China's Li Na 6-4 6-3 in the day's first semi-final at the $2 million Tokyo event.
"I expect a very tough match," Sharapova told reporters. "Jelena is a very solid player, a great mover, so it will be a very physical match. I'll have to fight for every point."
Sharapova, 25th in the world and chasing her first title since shoulder surgery last October, took the first set with a backhand bomb off a weak Radwanska second serve.
The Russian lost her way in the second, double-faulting to hand Radwanska a 5-2 lead, the 11th seed quickly closing out the set with a huge serve down the center line.
Shrieking louder and louder as the ferocity of her groundstrokes increased, Sharapova forged ahead 5-3 by smashing a forehand down the line, celebrating with a fist pump and a yell of "Come on!"
"I missed those match points by a hair," said Sharapova. "I knew I had to keep going for it and I did. I was able to step it up. I'm one win away now and I have to lay it all on the line."
Jankovic, who finished 2008 at the top of the world rankings, had too much firepower for Li but was given a good workout by the 15th seed in preparation for Saturday's final.
"My tennis is coming back," said the world number eight, who has won just one of five meetings with Sharapova. "It's been a very tough year but I believe in myself.
"I haven't played Maria for a long time and I don't really know how she's playing. But I still have a chance to win my third title this year which is pretty good."
