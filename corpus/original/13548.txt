UPDATE 1-Suntech, China Huadian partner on solar projects
2009-07-22 13:46:00.0
(Reuters) - Chinese solar panel maker Suntech Power Holdings Co (
The collaboration between China's largest solar panel maker and China Huadian New Energy Development Co could include some of the 1.8 gigawatts of Chinese projects Suntech announced last week.
Under the deal, Suntech will supply crystalline silicon solar panels and provide system design and technical support. China Huadian will oversee the project investment and development. The companies will sign separate agreements for the projects.
The news came a day after China launched a long-awaited plan to offer subsidies for large solar power projects, sparking a broad rally in shares of Chinese solar companies, including Suntech. In anticipation of China's move, Suntech last week struck deals to develop four solar power plants in China.
The projects announced on Wednesday will include utility-scale and commercial roof-top solar projects in China's Western provinces, Jiangsu province and Shanghai over the next three years, the companies said.
As the world's top greenhouse gas polluter, China is trying to catch up in a global race to find alternatives to fossil fuels, blamed for carbon emissions affecting the planet's climate. The financial crisis and lack of available financing for renewable energy projects has hit the solar industry hard this year.
Suntech's stock edged down about 0.3 percent at $17.75 on the New York Stock Exchange early Wednesday afternoon.
