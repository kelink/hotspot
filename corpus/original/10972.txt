FACTBOX: Japan PM Aso struggled to woo voters before poll

(Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso has struggled to rally support for his long-ruling conservative party for Sunday's election after a string of policy flip-flops, verbal gaffes and scandals in his cabinet.
Media polls forecast a major defeat for his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in the vote for parliament's lower house, which would end more than 50 years of almost unbroken rule by the business-friendly party.
Below are some facts about Aso, 68, who took office last September as Japan's fourth prime minister in four years.
* An outspoken nationalist, Aso has pushed for Japan to play a bigger global security role and has appealed to his party's conservative base before the vote. In 2006, after becoming foreign minister, Aso said there was nothing wrong with discussing whether Japan, the only country to suffer an atomic bombing, should possess nuclear arms. But as premier, he has stayed away from the Yasukuni Shrine for war dead, seen by many in Asia as a symbol of Japan's militarism before and during World War Two. He hosted a summit meeting with China and South Korea last year to bolster cooperation to tackle the global financial crisis, putting aside decades of animosity over history.
* Aso has launched massive economic stimulus packages to combat the financial crisis, but his efforts have been overshadowed by media fuss over policy flip-flops. His approval ratings have slid since he took office.
* Born into a wealthy family on the southern island of Kyushu, Aso has an elite political lineage. His grandfather, Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, negotiated the peace treaty ending World War Two, his father-in-law was also a prime minister, and his sister is married to a cousin of Emperor Akihito. He frequented posh hotel bars soon after taking office as premier, irking voters who accused him of being out of touch with ordinary people in a recession.
* A rarity among Japan's mostly staid politicians, Aso is a dapper dresser who appeals to fellow fans of "manga" comics and can work a crowd. He has authored several books, one of which, "Tremendous Japan," is a best-seller. He represented Japan in skeet shooting at the Montreal Olympics in 1976.
* His brash manner has provoked controversy. Aso was forced to apologize over a flippant remark about Alzheimer's disease in 2007 and he stirred anger in the two Koreas in 2003 for remarks seen as whitewashing Japan's 1919-1945 colonization of the peninsula. Last year, he upset doctors, a key political interest group, by saying many of them lacked common sense.
* A Catholic, Aso has advocated respect for traditional Japanese values, including the Shinto-based emperor system.
