UPDATE 1-Coal miner Massey's Q1 flat, revenue jumps
Tue  EDT
NEW YORK, April 28
Net income was $43.4 million, or 51 cents per share, compared with $41.9 million, or 52 cents per diluted share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $768.1 million from $644.6 million, the Richmond, Virginia-based company said.
Analysts had expected earnings of 53 cents per share and $716.78 million revenue, according to Reuters Estimates.
"Market demand and pricing remained weak," Chief Executive Officer Don Blankenship said in a statement. "Continuing weakness in the global economy has reduced demand for electric power and steel, thereby reducing demand for coal."
"In response to the current market conditions, Massey has taken meaningful action to reduce overall costs and expects to see measurable cost improvement going forward."
In January, Massey posted lower-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and said it was cutting production and pricing estimates for 2009 because of the economic downturn.
A ton of Eastern U.S. coal selling for $61.50 on Jan. 1 was going for $45.63 at the end of the quarter, according to the industry newsletter Coal & Energy Price Report.
