(Reuters) - The fall in 2009 global advertising spend will be almost twice as much as forecast, with the United States and Russia hit hard, a leading media network said on Thursday, although it saw a return to slight growth in 2010. Carat, owned by the Aegis Group AEGS.L, revised its forecast to a fall of 9.8 percent from an earlier prediction of a 5.8 percent fall due to "significant reductions" in spend across nearly all regions.
According to the report, among the worst hit markets in 2009 will be the United States, set to fall 16.3 percent, Britain down 11.7 percent, Italy down 12.4 percent, Spain down 19 percent and the Nordics down 19.2 percent.
Russia, however, is expected to fall 21.9 percent.
China is the only country forecast to show growth in 2009, up 6.9 percent, before global advertising trends start to recover in 2010, with a forecast of 1 percent global growth.
"These significant revisions are not unexpected in the context of the recent volatility of the market, and represent a cautious attitude towards adspend this year, most significantly in the US and Europe," said Jerry Buhlmann, CEO of Aegis Media.
"China remains the most resilient of the major economies, and we have revised our estimate upwards since March to 6.9 percent for 2009. However, even in China, we have noticed advertisers proceeding cautiously, and adjusting spend on a quarterly basis."
China was forecast to show growth of 9 percent in 2010, Russia up 1.5 percent and Britain up 1.4 percent, while the United States will contract 2.6 percent.
Of the different outlets, newspapers and magazines are set to be the hardest hit in 2009, down around 17 percent, while radio is set to fall 12.4 percent and TV down 6.3 percent. Online advertising in display and paid search is set to show growth of 1 percent.
