The victim, who died on Sunday, was an 18-year-old woman from the Tibetan autonomous region, who had been admitted to hospital the previous day complaining of a sore throat, cough and aches, the official Xinhua agency said.
The Health Ministry confirmed the death, but declined to comment further.
The government has reported the death to the World Health Organization and is now rushing 200,000 doses of vaccine to remote areas, state media said.
The government said at the end of September that there had been nearly 20,000 reported cases of the disease across the country, but over 14,000 had fully recovered and only 10 were seriously ill.
There are already strict checks at border crossings and many places where crowds gather like karaoke parlors, and the government began a mass vaccination program in late September, starting with around 100,000 students in Beijing.
Zhu said at the time that the government aimed to produce 26 million doses of vaccine by the end of October, and 65 million doses by the end of 2009.
Public service providers and vulnerable groups in densely populated cities and travel hubs would have priority, he added.
China's Sinovac reported last month that its vaccine protected patients with a single dose.
