The new fund, which it plans to launch this year, would be in addition to SAM's mainstream water fund, which is worth $1.5 billion as of May.
"We are planning a fund that will focus on companies that have 80 to 90 percent pure water exposure," Daniel Bruderer, head for SAM's clients and distribution in Asia and Middle East, told Reuters.
"The universe will be small," he said, adding that the fund is planning to invest in small-cap companies and companies in emerging markets.
"Specific companies that develop irrigation technology are example of companies we are looking at," he said.
Water shortages are on the rise, stemming from increased demand, growing populations and rising living standards, and compounded by climate change.
However, the government economic stimulus cash flowing into the water sector is expected to boost the sector, which is valued at $400 billion, experts said.
SAM's mainstream water fund invest in mid to large cap companies, which generate at least 20 percent of their revenue from water-related businesses.
The fund's largest holdings as of end June included French water and waste management firm Suez Environnement SA, scientific instruments maker Thermo Fisher of the United States and China's Guangdong Investment.
