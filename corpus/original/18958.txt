CME hogs seen lower, eye on infected Canada pigs
Mon  EDT
Pressure from H1N1 flu outbreaks continue to ease, but FAO saying there was transmission of the virus from a man to a herd of swine in Canada could be reason for concern, even though FAO said the incident was not surprising.
Called swine flu for much of last week, the influenza prompted up to 20 countries to ban pork or other meat from some or all U.S. states. The bans sparked selling in Chicago hog futures much of last week.
Russia on Monday banned all meat imports from South Carolina, but lifted bans from 6 other states.
* USDA on Friday put choice boxed beef cutout down $1.47 at $148.50, lowest since April 16, and select down $1.32 at $146.96.
* H1N1 flu continues to make headlines and could influence trade, but demand for meat could shift to beef if the problems persist.
* USDA on Friday reported the pork cutout down 95 cents at $55.68 per cwt, lowest since April 1.
* Carry-over support possible on apparent good demand for bacon, but futures may take their lead from hog futures.
