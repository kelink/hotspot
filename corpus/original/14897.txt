(Reuters) - The euro struggled back from its lowest levels in a week on Friday, after a wave of sell orders compounded losses made on bleak U.S. jobs numbers, and it found support as some investors judged it may have slipped too far.
Dealers said the euro hit stop-loss sell orders around $1.3980, and possible hedge fund selling, in the crossover between late U.S. trade and the start of the Asian day, sending it down to $1.3927

But analysts said market players then bought the euro back on Friday, helping it off the lows, although it was still weaker than before the employment data and investors were still dismayed the jobs numbers spelled a slower recovery than hoped.

RALLY OR STALL?
A rally in riskier currencies against the euro and yen has stalled in the past month as investors have fretted that, along with stock markets, it has got ahead of the economic recovery.
Traders said after the jobs data that investors cut long positions in these currencies against the yen and dollar, helping drive both higher, and analysts say investors need stronger evidence of economic turnaround to push on with the more pro-risk trades.
