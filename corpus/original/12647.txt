(Reuters) - Chinese iron ore stockpiles are receding to more normal levels, global miner BHP Billiton Ltd (
) said on Wednesday, adding a cautious note to its outlook for one of the world's hottest commodities.
BHP Billiton, the world's third-largest producer of the steel-making raw material, said China had finished rebuilding its iron ore stockpiles and that port stocks were now settling back to more normal levels, enough to sustain a month of consumption.
BHP Billiton's head of iron ore operations, Ian Ashby, also told a mining conference that he remained bullish on the overall outlook for demand for Australian iron ore, noting that the group's operations there were running at full capacity.
He also said shipments continued on schedule, despite market concerns that shipping to China had dropped off in recent weeks.
"It's not a matter of not being concerned, but our business is functioning as normal in China. That is fact," Ashby said.
"Chinese steel production has recovered quite rapidly -- last month it reached record highs," he added. "Most of this has been due to China's stimulus packages."
Ashby declined to comment on current price negotiations over iron ore supplies to China, the world's top producer and consumer of steel, or to other Asian customers.
BHP Billiton is trying to persuade customers to replace the current benchmark system of pricing iron ore, where annual prices are set entirely by negotiation, in favour of a more market-based model which relies on spot and index pricing.
BHP Billiton has said it has already sold 30 percent of its iron ore on spot-index pricing or through quarterly contracts. Tonnage accounting for 47 percent of its sales volumes had yet to be priced for the fiscal year to March 2010.
