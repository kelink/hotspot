(Reuters) - A Spanish court said on Tuesday it would free one of two suspected Somali pirates captured after the hijacking of a Spanish fishing boat because he appeared to be under 18 years old.
The immediate future of the suspect, whose name was erased from the official court document announcing the decision because his age could be less than 18, will now be in the hands of Spain's juvenile justice system, which could send him to a juvenile correction centre.
The pirates still in control of the boat, whose home port is in the Basque Country in northern Spain, have said they will not negotiate the crew's release until their two comrades are freed.
Spain has tried to enlist the support of Somalia's beleaguered government to obtain the liberation of the Alakrana.
China has said it was starting a rescue operation for a coal ship seized on Monday, leading to a threat on Tuesday from th pirates to kill the Chinese sailors onboard. [ID:nLK091937]
