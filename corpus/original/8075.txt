(Reuters) - Maclaren USA Inc is recalling about one million strollers sold in the United States over the past decade after receiving a dozen reports of children's fingers being amputated when caught in the stroller's hinges.
The CPSC said consumers should immediately stop using the strollers, which were made in China, unless otherwise instructed. The recall involves all Maclaren single and double umbrella strollers sold in the United States starting in 1999.
Maclaren said it has received 15 reports of children placing their finger in the stroller's hinge mechanism, which led to 12 reported fingertip amputations in the United States.
The incidents occurred while the strollers were being opened or closed, not while the children were seated in the strollers, a spokeswoman said.
Maclaren is offering consumers a free repair kit. The recall only relates to the British company's U.S. business.
Models affected by the recall include Volo, Triumph, Quest Sport, Quest Mod, Techno XT, TechnoXLR, Twin Triumph, Twin Techno and Easy Traveller.
The well-known strollers, priced from $100 to $360, were sold at stores including Babies "R" Us and Target (
