(Reuters) - A newly formed private company called Coda Automotive on Wednesday announced it will sell a fully electric car with a range of about 100 miles in the California market by autumn 2010 for around $45,000.
The company expects to sell about 3,000 "Coda Sedan" vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2010 that will be manufactured in China by state-owned Harbin Hafei Automotive.
They are to have lithium-ion batteries made by Tianjin Lishen Battery Joint-Stock Co based in Tianjin, China.
Coda Automotive is an offshoot of another private company, Miles Electric Vehicles, which sells low-speed fleet vehicles. It officially began operation on Wednesday with a demonstration of a prototype Coda Sedan in Santa Monica, California, where the company is located.
Kevin Czinger, president and CEO of Coda Automotive, said the car will be "for real drivers who need reliable transportation."
The Coda Sedan will actually cost consumers about $37,500 after a U.S. federal tax credit of $7,500 is applied.
Tesla Motors has delivered about 500 of its $109,000 electric roadsters -- 27 of which were recalled for suspension problems last week.
Tesla has plans to introduce a family sized four-door sedan in the third quarter of 2011 with a base price of about $57,000 -- and costing around $50,000 with the federal tax incentive. It is expected to have a range of 160 miles (257 kilometers) and top speed of 130 mph (210 kph). Tesla expects to initially make about 20,000 a year.
) has announed it will make the plug-in electric Chevrolet Volt to market in late 2010 and will manufacture about 10,000 in its first year.
The zero-emissions Coda family sedan car will have top speed of about 80 miles per hour (130 kilometers per hour) and will get a full charge from a 220-volt outlet in six hours and can charge enough for a 40-mile trip in two hours, Coda said. In a pinch, the car can be charged from a household 110-volt outlet, but it will take about five times as long as with a 220-volt system.
Coda estimates that it will cost less than $3 on average to drive the sedan 100 miles, compared with about $17 for a gasoline-powered car getting about 20 miles per gallon.
"The uncertainty of battery supply is an issue that plagues many electric vehicles manufacturers today," Czinger said in a press statement. "This long-term agreement (with Lishen) has enabled us to design an integrated battery system with an existing world-class partner with mass manufacturing capacity."
Coda wants to pre-sign buyers ahead of the fall 2010 sales launch. If there is enough demand, the company will be able to scale up to make 20,000 Coda Sedans in calendar 2011, Saltness said.
Coda expects to have its third round of investor funding later this year. Two rounds to fund development of the sedan have raised about $42 million, Saltness said.
