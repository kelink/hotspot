Iran says China not backing sanctions

(Reuters) - Iran's foreign ministry said on Tuesday it did not believe China was getting close to approving new sanctions which the United States wants to pressure Tehran over its nuclear program.
U.S. President Barack Obama and China's President Hu Jintao met on Monday at a nuclear security summit in Washington where, according to a U.S. official, Hu said his government would help craft a new Security Council resolution on Iran.
A Chinese spokesman said Hu had told Obama that China shared the goal of reining in Iran's nuclear program, but stopped short of saying he explicitly backed new sanctions.
"We have repeated many times that the concept of sanctions and issuing resolutions is unjust and irrational and does not have any effect on our nation's determination to achieve its rights," Mehmanparast said.
He warned that countries that impose sanctions on the world's fifth largest oil exporter would themselves suffer economically.
"Any country that helps (the West) in this regard will deprive itself -- to the same extent that it helps -- of the interests which it could enjoy by having ties with Iran," said Mehmanparast.
On Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said Beijing supported a "dual-track strategy" toward Iran, implying sanctions were a possibility, but stressing the importance of negotiations to resolve the nuclear standoff.
Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who sees the heavily nuclear armed United States as the greatest threat to global security, said Obama's summit on preventing nuclear terrorism was "intended to humiliate human beings.
