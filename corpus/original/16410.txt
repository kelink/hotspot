ANALYST VIEW 4-Japan to set 15% emission cut from 05 level-media

(Reuters) - Japan, the world's fifth-biggest greenhouse gas emitter, will target a cut in emissions by 15 percent by 2020 from 2005 levels, Kyodo news agency said on Wednesday.
Prime Minister Taro Aso is to hold a news conference to announce Japan's greenhouse gas emissions reduction target at 6 p.m. (0900 GMT). *************************************************************
-- If Aso confirms the target, it would be equivalent to a cut of 8.5 percent below Japan's 1990 emission levels to 1.154 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, not much more than the 6 percent cut Japan committed itself to under the Kyoto Protocol for the 2008-12 period.
-- A 15 percent cut from 2005 levels would be slightly more than a widely expected cut of 14 percent, which had been one of the options put forward by officials seeking to balance the need to slow climate change with the cost to Japan, whose economy relies heavily on steel and other manufacturing industries.

"Prime Minister Aso's reported plan is appalling. When signing the Kyoto Protocol, Japan already committed to a 6 percent cut from 1990 levels, to be achieved from 2008 to 2012. The new Aso target would mean that Japan effectively gives dirty industries the freedom to pollute without limits for eight years."
HIDEFUMI KURASAKA, PROFESSOR OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES, CHIBA UNIVERSITY, JAPAN
"Japan's population is falling, so that means it has an advantage over the United States. The fact that Japan can commit to only an 8 percent cut (from 1990 levels) even as its population falls will lead to doubts over its seriousness to fight climate change.
"Competition to develop technology for renewable energy, in areas such as fuel cells and SMART grids, is already under way around the world. For industries to grow in these areas, there needs to be strong policies. There needs to be political leadership to set direction for industries, but there's no sign of that in this target."

"My first impression is that it is a very challenging goal, because industry had sought a 4 percent rise, and I truly wonder if it is achievable.
"At this point, I don't have a good idea on what effect this 15 percent goal would have on utilities."
SATOSHI HASHIMOTO, ANALYST, MITSUBISHI RESEARCH INSTITUTE
"It's balanced in light of domestic and global considerations, and balanced in terms of Japan's initial stance going into future negotiations in creating a post-Kyodo framework.
"As society is moving towards using less fuel, it will be costly to respond to measures needed to slow global warming, and business and households must brace for that. At the same time, a move towards green energy should open the way to new business opportunities."
MATTHEW CLARKE, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, SCHOOL OF INTERNATIONAL AND POLITICAL STUDIES, DEAKIN UNIVERSITY, MELBOURNE
"Japan's (expected) announcement will not put any pressure on China or India. Japan also needs to make longer-term commitments beyond 2020 to indicate its longer emissions targets."
-- U.N. climate talks in December in the Danish capital Copenhagen aim to seal a broader climate pact to replace Kyoto from 2013. Japan's target is seen as an important signal of the level of ambition of rich nations to fight global warming.
-- Under the Kyoto Protocol, Japan committed itself to cut emissions by 6 percent from 1990 levels to 1,186 million tonnes on average over the 2008-2012 period, part of which it promised would come from the purchase of carbon offsets from abroad. But Japan has struggled to meet its Kyoto goal.
-- In the United States, the only major developed nation outside Kyoto, a climate bill recently approved by a congressional panel aimed at a cut of 17 percent by 2020 from 2005 levels. (Reporting by Tokyo Newsroom)
