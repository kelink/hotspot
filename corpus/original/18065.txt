) citing concerns about the bank's ability to raise the $33.9 billion of fresh capital required by the U.S. government's recent stress tests.
Fitch cut the bank's preferred stock rating by three notches to B, or five notches into junk status, it said in a statement.
The agency cut the bank's trust preferred ratings one notch to BB-minus, or three levels into junk, and said both ratings remain on negative watch, meaning it could downgrade them again within the next 12 to 18 months.
At the same time, Fitch affirmed Bank of America's long- and short-term individual default rating at A-plus, or fifth-highest investment grade as both are backed up by government support.
"However, success in reaching the goal requires market access, ability to arrange sales of other units at a sufficient price, and maintenance of earnings above SCAP (Supervisory Capital Assessment Program) projections," said the statement.
Earnings may be the most challenging of the three factors, it said. The bank may have to book further losses on a number of portfolios that remain stressed, such as home equity loans and credit cards, it said.
"BAC also is faced with the integration of several complex recent mergers and the potential for further mark-to-market charges in distressed assets such as collateralized debt obligations, leveraged loans and commercial mortgage-backed securities," said Fitch.
The risk that the bank will have to omit or defer dividends on hybrid securities has increased, with the omission of a dividend on preferred stock the greater risk, said the agency.
