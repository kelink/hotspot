(Reuters) - Spain's BBVA (
) expects margins at its private bank operations to recover about 10 percent in coming months, the chief investment officer at its fund management arm said on Tuesday.
"What we are doing now is recovering the margins we had before the crisis. We don't think margins are going to expand dramatically since we are in a low interest rate environment. But I think we might recover about 10 percent," Enrique Marazuela said at the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit.
While the market value of assets under management at its private banking arm fell last year, volumes increased as BBVA gained market share, Marazuela said.
"There was a clear flight to quality. We gained share mainly from the private banking operations linked to investment banks. Customers from Lehmans and other investment banks came to us," he said.
BBVA's private banking division is closely linked to its retail banking operations across the globe, with a strong presence in Latin America and growing exposure in China through its alliance with Citic group.
Clients are now recovering some appetite for risk and have been focusing more on equity investments, Marazuela said, although he acknowledged their portfolios are still underweight in stocks.
BBVA is considering adding commodities as an asset class to recommend to its wealthy clients, Marazuela said.
"In investments, the only free lunch we had was in diversification. We want to add more asset classes and we are thinking about commodities," he said.
