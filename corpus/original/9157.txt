(Reuters) - Japan, the world's fifth-biggest air polluter, offered a $400 million yen-denominated loan Sunday to Indonesia, the world's third-largest air polluter, to help tackle global warming, Japanese officials said.
The loan was part of the "Hatoyama Initiative" unveiled last month by Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, in which Tokyo will provide financial and technical assistance to developing countries to help address the problem of climate change.
The initiative was originally proposed by Hatoyama's predecessor and amended by his government as the United Nations Climate Change Secretariat wants developed nations to come up with at least $10 billion in initial funding.
Final details of Japan's new funding initiative may not be ready in time for the last formal U.N. negotiating session before the Copenhagen climate meeting in early November.
The loan offer to Indonesia came a day after Hatoyama urged his Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh to make an international commitment on climate change, saying it was vital for a U.N. deal due in Copenhagen in December.
