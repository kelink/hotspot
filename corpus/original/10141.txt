The 22-year-old Serbian, who won the Masters Cup in its final year as the season-ending men's tour championship in Shanghai last November, returns to China's financial capital this week for the inaugural Shanghai Masters.
Just reaching Sunday's final at the Olympic tennis center, where he won a bronze at the Beijing Games last year, also means he will overtake Andy Murray later this month as world number three after the Briton withdrew from Shanghai with a wrist injury.
"I feel very confident playing on Asian soil, where I have had a lot of success in the last two years," Djokovic told reporters after his 6-2 7-6 win over Croatian Marin Cilic.
"I'm going to be playing in the same club and coming to Shanghai with a victory in Beijing certainly gives me a lot of motivation.
"I'm just going try and recover before my upcoming match and then all do it over again," the 2008 Australian Open champion added.
"I'm not going to have a lot of time to celebrate this for sure."
Djokovic is the second seed at the Shanghai Masters, which got underway on Sunday, and will face Latvian Ernests Gulbis or a qualifier in the second round after being given a first-round bye.
