(Reuters) - Germany's parties are campaigning for an election on September 27 which could usher in a new coalition. Polls show Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives (CDU/CSU) may win enough votes to form a coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP).
Below is a comparison of the leading parties' policies, highlighting their contrasting positions on issues where there are major differences:
* CDU/CSU - Reject tax increases and call for a two-step cut in the lowest income tax bracket to 12 percent from 14 percent. Want to raise the threshold for highest regular income tax rate of 42 percent to 60,000 euros ($84,320) from 52,552 euros.
* SPD (Social Democrats) - Want to cut the lowest income tax rate to 10 percent from 14 percent. Would raise the top tax rate -- including a "rich tax" for the super wealthy -- to 47 percent from 45 percent. Would tax stock market trades of 1,000 euros or more at a rate of 0.5 percent or 1.5 percent.
* FDP (Free Democrats) - Plan tax cuts aimed at families and middle income earners worth up to 35 billion euros. The party wants to simplify the tax system and shift to a three-band system, with rates of 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent.
* LEFT PARTY - Want a "redistribution from the top to the bottom." Only incomes of above 12,000 euros per year should be taxed and the top tax rate should be raised to 53 percent. Wants a "millionaire's tax" on private wealth.
* SPD - Aim to create 4 million jobs by 2020. Want binding minimum wages for as many sectors as possible, and preferably a general minimum wage. The SPD would try to retain Germany's industrial base and sees the biggest opportunities in green technology.
* FDP - Want to strengthen the so-called "Mittelstand" small- and medium-sized businesses that form the backbone of the German economy; propose business tax rates of 10 and 25 percent compared to just under 30 percent now. Rules on protecting workers from dismissal would be loosened. Want a comprehensive program of privatizations.
* LEFT PARTY - Private banks should be nationalized; employees should have a larger stake in their companies; mass layoffs at firms not facing insolvency should be banned.
* CDU/CSU - Against Turkey joining the EU. Germany should continue its participation in NATO's mission in Afghanistan.
* GREENS - Have moved away from their pacifist roots and broadly back the Afghanistan mission. Support Turkey's EU bid and favor tough line on human rights with Russia and China.
* SPD - Would keep its policy of phasing out nuclear energy. The SPD wants Germany to cut its dependence on oil imports, and get half of its power from renewable sources by 2030.
* GREENS - By 2020, reduce CO2 emissions by 40 percent compared to 1990 levels. By 2020, at least 40 percent of electricity from renewable energies.
