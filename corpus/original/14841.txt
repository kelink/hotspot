FOREX-Euro recovers vs dlr; trade thin on US holiday

(Reuters) - The euro edged higher against the dollar on Friday, correcting after sharp falls late the previous session in the wake of bleak U.S. jobs numbers which dampened hopes for a global economic recovery.
Trade was quiet, however, with U.S. markets closed for a public holiday.
The euro and perceived higher risk currencies such as the Australian dollar, which have benefited from hopes of an economic turnaround, weakened sharply on Thursday after data showed U.S. employers cut a substantial 467,000 jobs in June. [ID:nN01210643]
But analysts said market players then bought these currencies back on Friday, judging that the falls may have been overdone. This kept the euro hovering around the $1.40 level, although it was still weaker than before the U.S. jobs data.
The euro reacted little to weaker-than-forecast euro zone retail sales data and a slight upward revision to the purchasing managers' survey for services in the region.
"There has been a bit of a recovery in risk currencies, which got really hammered yesterday," said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, head of FX research at Danske Bank in Copenhagen.
"But with the U.S. closed it's a bit of a dull market today, with everyone taking a breather after yesterday's hectic movements," he said, adding that many investors had already closed their positions ahead of the long weekend in the U.S.
At 1029 GMT, the euro stood at $1.3991
, up 0.4 percent from a U.S. close taken at 2130 GMT, while against the yen it also recovered to trade up 0.3 percent at 134.20 yen EURJPY=R.
Among perceived riskier currencies, the Australian dollar gained 0.6 percent to $0.7976
, while the New Zealand dollar rose 0.9 percent to $0.6324
TENTATIVE RECOVERY?
Despite the euro's recovery, the common currency stayed well below a one-month high above $1.4200 hit earlier in the week, with some analysts saying any gains are likely to be limited due to concerns about the sustainability of any economic improvement.
"The activity post the non-farm payrolls data may be the first sign that things are starting to run out of steam in terms of the currency play versus the dollar," BNP Paribas analyst Ian Stannard said.
Data on Friday showed euro zone retail sales fell more than expected, dropping 0.4 percent during May for an annual decline of 3.3 percent [ID:nL3586161].
The euro zone services PMI index was revised up to 44.7 in June from the flash estimate of 44.5, though it still left the reading below May's 44.8. [ID:nLAG003581].
With the U.S. jobs data out of the way, traders said focus was shifting to the Group of Eight meeting on July 8-10.
China has been talking about diversification of the international currency system, and said it would be "normal" for the issue to be raised at next week's G8 summit. [ID:nPEK137542].
