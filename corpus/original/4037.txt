(Reuters) - China's IPO market slowed by a fifth in the first half of 2011 amid a lack of mega deals that hit the market the year before, with fundraisings dominated by small businesses, a trend that analysts said could last for a few more months.
In the first six months, only about one tenth of companies seeking a listing had chosen to do so on the Shanghai Stock Exchange while the rest had gone to the smaller Shenzhen bourse, which houses the Nasdaq-style ChiNext market.

In Shenzhen, 136 companies raised a total of $16.6 billion on the ChiNext and the SME board in the first half, accounting for more than two-thirds of the total proceeds raised in mainland China.
The fundraising boom on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange helped lift Shenzhen-based investment banks, such as Guosen Securities and Ping An Securities to the top spots of the China IPO league table.
Guosen Securities secured the No.1 position in the first half of 2011, clinching 18 deals with a combined deal value of $2.8 billion, Thomson Reuters data showed. Guosen was ranked third in the same period last year.
Ping An Securities, a unit of Ping An Insurance (
), maintained its No.2 place with 17 deals worth $2.1 billion.
) was ranked fifth with two deals worth $1.2 billion. UBS was the underwriter of the Pangda IPO as well as carmaker BYD's (
), which handled the Sinovel deal, the only IPO deal it had in the first half, was ranked 11th.
China was the world's largest IPO market in 2010, with 347 companies including Agricultural Bank of China (
Shang Fulin, the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission told a financial forum in Shanghai last month that the international board is "coming closer and closer to us."

"The international board fits well with China's strategic interest, I think any decision regarding the board is less likely to be swayed by market factors," said Cao at Huaxi Securities.
