(Reuters) - Emerging market debt trading volumes fell sharply in the first quarter compared to last year as investors grew cautious amid the global recession, though there are hints of a rebound in place, a new survey shows.
EMTA, a trade association for emerging markets, said on Thursday that trading volumes fell 23 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2009 to $915 billion. Local currency debt accounted for 72 percent of the trading volume turnover.
However, trading volumes did pick up from the fourth quarter of last year, rising 11 percent, when emerging market fixed income levels reached their lowest quarterly amount in six years.
Local market trading volumes of $656 billion were more than twice the $253 million traded in Eurobonds. Both categories however were down year-on-year, 19 percent and 30 percent, respectively.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, local debt trade rose by 18 percent while Eurobond trade was roughly even the fourth quarter. EMTA surveyed 46 firms.
"I would have expected that local markets would have seen less of a recovery than was experienced in hard currency markets," said David Spegel, global head of emerging market strategy at ING and an EMTA board member based in New York.
"Investors were happy with their dollar exposure," during this period Spegel said.
Brazil maintained its top rank as the country with the biggest volume share of debt traded at 19 percent, followed by Turkey with 15 percent and China with 10 percent in the first quarter.
