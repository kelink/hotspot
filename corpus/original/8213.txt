The aid offer is double that unveiled by President Hu Jintao at the last summit in Beijing in 2006, as China aims to boost a relationship which politically goes back decades and is now economically booming, to the discomfort of some in the West.
Details of China's offer are as follows:
* China will give $10 billion in concessional loans to Africa to build up financing capacity, and will support Chinese financial institutions in setting up a $1 billion fund for loans to small- and medium-sized African companies. China will also cancel more African debt.
* China and Africa establish a partnership to respond to climate change, and will build 100 clean energy projects in Africa including solar power, biogas and small-scale hydro-power.
* China, to boost African food security, will send 50 agriculture technology teams to Africa and train 2,000 agricultural technology personnel for Africa.
* China will provide 500 million yuan in medical equipment and anti-malarial materials to 30 hospitals and 30 malaria treatment centres in Africa, and will train 3,000 doctors and nurses.
* China will build 50 schools and train 1,500 teachers for Africa. By 2012, China will increase the number of scholarships available to African students to 5,500.
* China and Africa will enhance science and technology cooperation, and China will host 100 African postdoctoral fellows to conduct scientific research in China.
