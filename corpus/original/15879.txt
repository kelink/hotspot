Analysts Marcelo Aguiar, Pedro Grimaldi and Eduardo Couto said in the report that they were "more bullish on pulp than paper stocks due to a better demand and pricing outlook." They said risks included a strengthening Brazilian currency, lower pulp and paper prices and weaker demand for paper.
The report said an increase in pulp demand by China, caused by its growing need for fiber to accommodate urbanization, would help offset a decline in demand in other countries.
The average price for eucalyptus pulp is expected to rise to $645 per tonne from a previous estimate of $608, according to the Goldman report.
VCP has agreed to take over Aracruz in a $1.7 billion deal. The report said VCP was expensive at current prices. The company's shares rose 2.2 percent to 21.45 reais on Tuesday.
The Goldman analysts also recommended adding Suzano on a "bullish view on pulp price cycle, relatively inexpensive multiples and high exposure to Chinese pulp market, which should allow the company to keep sales volume high in the near term."
