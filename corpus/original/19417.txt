(Reuters) - China's Sichuan Changhong Electric Co's (
) first-quarter net profit plunged 97 percent from a year earlier, it said on Tuesday, as a fall in profit margin and investment losses hit its bottom lines.
Changhong, one of China's top TV makers and a leading maker of electrical appliances, posted a net profit attributable to the listed company's shareholders of only 2.7 million yuan ($395,000) in the first quarter from 95.3 million yuan a year earlier, it said in its quarterly earnings report.
Changhong, also a major TV and appliance exporter to the crisis-hit United States and Europe, did not give explanations.
But its report showed its returns on assets (ROA) dropped 1.01 percentage point from a year ago to 0.03 percent in the first quarter, as the financial crisis dampened demand for appliances, forcing producers to sell at lower prices or even at a loss.
Changhong also suffered an investment loss of 6.3 million yuan in the first quarter compared with an investment profit of 23 million in the same period of last year, according to its quarterly report published in the official Shanghai Securities News.
The poor quarterly earnings came after Changhong announced on Saturday that its full-year net profit for 2008 fell 91.6 percent to 31.12 million yuan. It attributed the annual fall partly to damage from last May's earthquake in southwest China. ($1=6.83 Yuan) (Reporting by Lu Jianxin and Edmund Klamann; Editing by Ken Wills)
