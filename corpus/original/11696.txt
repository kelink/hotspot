(Reuters) - Investors significantly moved to overweight equities and cut cash and bonds in August, while they shifted out of China into Russia as growth optimism in China eased, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The Merrill Lynch fund managers survey, which polled 204 investors who manage a combined $554 billion, showed equity overweight positions rose to a net 34 percent of their portfolios in August, their highest since October 2007, from 7 percent last month.
At -28 percent, net bond overweight positions were at their lowest since April 2007.
The average cash balance fell to 3.5 percent of the portfolio in August, its lowest since July 2007, from 4.7 percent last month.
"This is the most bullish survey in about two years. It's a turnaround from the depth of pessimism we had in March. But the optimism is skin-deep. People underneath are not confident," Patrik Schowitz, European equity strategist at Banc of America-Merrill Lynch Securities, told a briefing.
Respondents cut exposure to Chinese equities to neutral from overweight. They liked growth and liquidity plays in Russia, Turkey and Indonesia. Defensive markets such as Chile, Malaysia and Israel were least favoured. Investors moved overweight in Korea for the first time in two years.
"Growth optimism in China is a bit down. China is no longer the most overweight country," Schowitz said.
