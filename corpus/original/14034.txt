(Reuters) - Canada's Grande Cache Coal Corp GCE.TO reported a more than two-fold jump in its first-quarter sales volume, driven by strong demand from China, and raised its fiscal 2010 sales volume outlook, sending its shares up almost 8 percent.
"The increase (in outlook) is due to a higher level of spot sales experienced to date, together with a modest recovery in demand from traditional customers compared to the latter part of fiscal 2009," the company said.
For the three months ended June 30, the company sold 0.51 million tonnes of metallurgical coal, up from 0.25 million tonnes a year ago, as it was helped by a significant increase in spot sales, primarily into the Chinese market.
Grande Cache, which produces metallurgical coal for the steel industry, boosted its fiscal 2010 sales volume outlook to between 1.3 and 1.5 million tonnes of coal, from its prior estimate of 1.2 to 1.4 million tonnes of coal.
Grande Cache shares were up 14 Canadian cents or about 8 percent at C$1.99 Tuesday morning on the Toronto Stock Exchange. ($1=1.148 Canadian dollar) (Reporting by R. Manikandan, Ashutosh Joshi in Bangalore; Editing by Himani Sarkar)
