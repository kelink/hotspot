(Reuters) - Anti-government protesters rallied on Saturday to demand a petition calling for a royal pardon for fugitive former premier Thaksin Shinawatra be submitted to the country's revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
The demonstration by the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship took place in Bangkok two days after concerns about the king's health triggered a seven percent plunge in the Thai stock market as panicked investors offloaded their Thai assets.
Bhumibol, the world's longest-reigning monarch, is seen as a unifying figure in the country of 67 million people. He has been treated in hospital since Sept. 19 for fatigue, loss of appetite and pneumonia, the Bureau of the Royal Household said.
Risk analysis firm IHS Global Insight assigns countries an overall risk rating of 1 to 5. The higher the number, the greater the perceived risk for companies operating in that country. Here's the IHS latest rankings, issued in October.
The WGI project, backed by the World Bank, produces a comprehensive set of annual indicators for six dimensions of governance. The numbers represent the country's relative world ranking, with 100 being the highest and 0 the lowest.
In an analysis published in March, the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked the world's countries according to their vulnerability to social or political unrest.
Countries were rated from 1 to 10. The higher the number, the greater the perceived vulnerability to unrest.
