(Reuters) - Japanese government bond futures hit a seven-month low on Wednesday as Tokyo shares rallied after a sharp rebound in consumer confidence in the United States lifted hopes for the global economy.
U.S. consumer confidence soared in May to its highest level in eight months, also pushing Treasuries lower despite positive sentiment from a solid auction of two-year notes.
"JGBs had been relatively steady despite the rally in stocks but with the benchmark U.S. yield hitting 3.5 percent and the Nikkei rising near 9,500, investors adjusted their positions," said Kazuya Ito, a fund manager at Daiwa SB Investments
June 10-year futures fell 0.46 point to 136.36 2JGBv1 after dropping as low as 136.23, their lowest since October 22.
The benchmark 10-year yield JP10YTN=JBTC rose 3 basis points to 1.470 percent after touching 1.475 percent, its highest since April 10.
Traders said the decline in futures was likely exacerbated by selling by commodity trading advisers (CTAs), which use programmes to trade financial markets.
JGBs found some support from month-end buying by investors extending the durations of their bond holdings, analysts said.
"Those who had cut their holdings of risk assets seem to be putting some of their money back in stocks and commodities," said Tetsuya Miura, chief market analyst at Mizuho Securities.
He said the 10-year JGB yield could rise to 1.5 percent in near term and JGB futures may drop to 135.46, a low last seen in October but added such moves would likely only be temporary as there hadn't been much change in the real economy.
The five-year yield JP5YTN=JBTC climbed 2.5 basis points to 0.830 percent. The two-year yield JP2YTN=JBTC was steady at 0.355 percent, while the 20-year yield JP20YTN=JBTC rose 1.5 basis point to 2.120 percent.
The yield for 10-year U.S. Treasury notes climbed above 3.55 percent on Tuesday, the highest since mid-November, while the Nikkei rose 1.4 pct to 9,438.77 on Wednesday. [US/] [.T]
The Bank of Japan's minutes from its April 30 policy meeting showed one board member said the BOJ needed to watch the impact on the JGB market of a big rise in issuance as the government plans to borrow heavily to fund economic stimulus steps. [ID:nTKZ006267]
Investors remained cautious about ongoing supply worries in the U.S. Treasuries market before auctions for five- and seven-year notes on Wednesday and Thursday respectively. Total issuance for this week is slated to be $101 billion, including Tuesday's 2-year auction. [US/]
Japan's exports showed modest signs of recovery in April with shipments to China declining at a slower pace than a year earlier, reinforcing market views that the worst of the global slump in trade may be over. A drop in exports to the U.S. was smaller than in March. [JPEXPY=ECI]
