Carlisle, which in a regulatory filing said it expects to incur charges of $14.2 million during 2010, is also planning for a decline of about 25 percent in 2009 revenue.
"Our end market conditions continue to be a challenge," Chief Executive David Roberts said in a statement.
The company -- which makes construction materials, specialty tire and wheel, and aerospace wire and cables -- plans to consolidate its tire operations from Carlisle, Pennsylvania, Heflin, Alabama and portions of its operations in China into a new facility in Jackson, Tennessee.

The company will incur charges of $0.9 million related to its trailer manufacturing consolidation during the rest of 2009, the company said in the regulatory filing.
The tire facility consolidation will begin in July and is expected to continue through Dec. 31, 2010, while the trailer facility consolidation is expected to begin in July and continue through Dec. 31, 2009.
Carlisle is also closing its Kent, Washington aerospace facility and will move the production to its Tukwila, Washington aerospace facility.
