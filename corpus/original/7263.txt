Sales in the United States in 2009 plunged to just 10.4 million cars and light trucks, the lowest level in 27 years.
In December, Ford sales surged 33 percent from a year earlier and it gained market share for the full year, reversing a slide that began in 1995.
Toyota Motor Corp, battling to restore an image for market-leading quality and safety, was just behind Ford with a 32 percent sales gain for December.
Even after a 20 percent drop in sales for the year, Toyota said it had emerged as the top-selling automaker on a retail basis in the United States, topping GM for the first time.
"For 2010, I'm leaving my seatbelt on because I think that volatility is part of the new norm," said Ford sales chief Ken Czubay.
December results for other major automakers were mixed. General Motors Co and Chrysler, which both filed for bankruptcy in 2009, lagged. Chrysler's sales dropped 4 percent. GM posted a sales decline of 6 percent.
