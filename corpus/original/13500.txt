U.S. pork supply balloons as swine flu curbs demand

(Reuters) - U.S. pork supplies held in storage ballooned to the highest level ever for the month of June as consumers turned to other meats amid the spread in swine flu, the government and analysts said on Wednesday.
USDA data showed that total pork stocks in June of 578.8 million lbs were down one percent from May but were up nine percent from a year ago, and a record high at end-June.
"We've got the largest (total pork stocks) number on record for this particular month's (June) report," said livestock analyst Rich Nelson of brokerage Allendale Inc.
"We had a drawdown of 6 million pounds from last month. Typically, we draw down about 40 million pounds," he said, adding that the built-up in stocks showed that U.S. pork exports continued to be curtailed by swine flu.
H1N1, known as swine flu despite being spread by humans, caused the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century, spreading globally in just a few weeks, infecting millions.
"This confirms that we're still having export problems," Nelson said, citing sales China in particular.
Ron Plain, livestock economist at the University of Missouri, said the June data compared with the all-time record for any month of 663 million lbs in storage on April 30, 2008.
"It was the weekend of April 25th and 26th is when it (swine flu) hit the news. Pork stocks started growing in May and that continued into June," he said.
Ham stocks rose 23 percent from end-May. "Ham prices were pathetic in June and apparently for good reason. For that much to be put into cold storage it obviously wasn't a product that was moving very fast," Plain said.
