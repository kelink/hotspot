HK confirms 3nd H1N1 case, hunts for 100 passengers
Sun  EDT
"He arrived at around 7 p.m. (Hong Kong time) in the evening yesterday (May 16) and was sent straight to hospital," said Thomas Tsang, controller of the Centre for Health Protection.
Potentially more than 100 passengers sat in the three rows in front and behind the 23-year-old university student, who lives in China's Guangdong province, on flight CX 831 from New York, and Tsang urged them to contact the government hotline.
The territory's first confirmed H1N1 case, which involved a Mexican man, was reported on May 1, leading to the quarantine of a downtown hotel where he had stayed.
Authorities in Hong Kong have since revised their flu containment strategies, saying for future cases involving an infected hotel guest only certain floors would be quarantined. (For more Reuters stories on swine flu, click on [nFLU])
