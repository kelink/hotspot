China arable land fears end reforestation drive

(Reuters) - China has halted a program of letting marginal farmland return to woodland, because of fears the country's arable land area could fall below a "red line" needed to feed its people, a vice minister said on Tuesday.
Lu Xinshe, deputy head of the Ministry of Land and Resources, said China was losing too many fields to industrialization to allow any more land to be returned to its natural state.
"To protect our "red line" of 1.8 billion mu of arable land ... we will not plan any new large scale projects to return farmland to its natural state, beyond those that have already been planned," he told a news conference in the Chinese capital.
Self-sufficiency in grains has been a China priority for decades, and sometimes led to farming on marginal land that might be better suited for grazing livestock or growing crops other than grains.
China is already edging dangerously close to its "red line" of 1.8 billion mu of arable land, with just 1.826 billion mu (121.7 million hectares) available the end of last year, Liu told a news conference.
"If we just look at the overall data, it is unimaginable that China could hold the 1.8 billion mu 'red line', as China is still in the period of fast industrialization and urbanization, and taking over some arable land is inevitable," Lu said.
"Every year around 4 million mu of land is added," Lu said.
But as legal compensation for expropriated cropland is much lower than the price the land fetches for industrial or residential development, there are many incentives for local officials to rezone or simply seize land. Land sales are also a major source of revenue for local governments.
Land disputes are one of the major sources of unrest in China, and a particular concern for a Communist government that originally seized power with the support of discontented farmers.
