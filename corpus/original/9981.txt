METALS-Copper settles lower as demand doubts weigh
2009-10-13 14:43:00.0
(Reuters) - Copper prices closed down at their lowest levels in nearly one week on Tuesday as concerns about the pace of economic recovery returned, with the market still short of evidence of improved metals demand.
"I think we are just seeing some exhaustion right now," said Michael Gross, futures analyst with Optionsellers.com in Tampa, Florida. "We are seeing some profit-taking in a market that appears to be over-bought and probably fundamentally over-priced."
Copper for December delivery HGZ9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division shed 6.25 cents, or 2.2 percent, to settle at $2.7945 a lb, its lowest level on a closing basis since Oct. 7.
On the London Metal Exchange (LME), copper for three-month delivery MCU3 ended down $135 at $6,140 a tonne, recouping some of a 3 percent fall to the day's low of $6,055.25.
Highlighting weak demand, LME inventories for copper, used in power and construction, rose 575 tonnes to remain near five-months highs at 347,950 tonnes. <LME/STX1>
"Basically the market is waiting for signs of an improvement in the real economy and it's the timing of that recovery that is uncertain," said Standard Bank analyst Leon Westgate.
Looking ahead, all eyes will be on Chinese copper import data on Wednesday, which are expected to show inbound shipments down for a third consecutive month, after record imports in the first half of the year. [ID:nFLLCMM2UZ]
"That would be a real blow to the bulls as the story of China buying at any price might be blown up," said Eugen Weinberg, an analyst at Commerzbank.

Also, with workers at Escondida in Chile having accepted an early wage offer from BHP Billiton, the impact of the Spence strike was further muted. Escondida is the world's biggest copper mine. [ID:nN13176456] RUNNING AHEAD Chinese stockpiling, improving macro data and new investor cash have helped copper prices to roughly double this year. But with the stockpiling slowing and persistent doubts over the pace of a global recovery, industry executives gathering at the annual London Metal Exchange week, have spoken about prices running ahead of fundamentals. [ID:nL8107826] Rio Tinto (
) said on Tuesday it saw some downside risk to copper prices over the next 12 months, adding it expected Chinese copper imports to slow. [ID:nLD662996] The miner remained upbeat about the price in the longer term, however, due to expected supply problems.
