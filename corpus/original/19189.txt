(Reuters) - Kazakh oil producer KazMunaiGas Exploration and Production (KMG EP) (
"The planned reduction of production level reflects the adjustment of the Company's budget to the lower oil price environment anticipated in 2009," KMG EP said on Thursday.
KMG EP's majority shareholder, Kazakh state oil and gas firm KazMunaiGas [KMG.UL] , earlier this month agreed to buy another local producer MangistauMunaiGas (MMG) together with China's CNPC.
"It is anticipated that after this transaction is finalised, the negotiations concerning the acquisition of a stake in MMG by KMG EP will commence," it said.
The company has earlier said it would not increase planned 2009 capital expenditure in spite of the 18-percent devaluation of the Kazakh tenge currency in February, thus cutting it in dollar terms to around $265 million. (Writing by Olzhas Auyezov; editing by Simon Jessop)
