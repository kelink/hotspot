(Reuters) - China will support Sudan to develop its oil sector and other industries, its foreign minister said on Sunday, after the highest-level talks between the two allies since South Sudan became independent.
"China is ready to cooperate with Sudan in many areas, especially in the oil sector....and agriculture and mining sector," Yang told reporters after meeting Bashir late on Sunday, speaking through a translator.
Khartoum and Juba have yet to agree on who will control Abyei, stirring fears that long-running quarrel over the region could sour the secession and spark a broader conflict.
Yang said China was paying attention to ongoing violence in Southern Kordofan, a volatile and oil-rich border territory.
"China is following the recent development of the situation in South Kordofan State and it has exerted efforts with the concerned parties to calm the situation there," Yang said, according to a statement by the Chinese foreign ministry.
Yang said the situation in Darfur, another region where rebels have fought the Khartoum government, could only be resolved through elimination of poverty and through development, which would lead to peaceful co-existence among tribes.
U.N. peacekeepers have said North Sudan has carried out air strikes in Darfur, killing one civilian, in the first confirmed strike since Khartoum signed a peace deal with small rebel group Liberation and Justice Movement (LJM) in July.
