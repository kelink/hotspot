(Reuters) - U.S. hog prices were lower in early electronic trading and appear set to trade lower in Chicago's pit-traded markets on Tuesday as worries that the swine flu spreading around the world will weaken economies, slow trade and hurt meat consumption.
However, market pressures eased as the death toll from the flu appears confined to Mexico and the cases in the United States have so far been mild with patients recovering.
The flu, which is not related to hogs or transmitted by pork or any other meat, has killed up to 149 people in Mexico and sickened 40 in the United States. So far, no one outside Mexico has died from the virus.
Russia, an import market for U.S. meat, has banned raw meat from U.S. states that have had human cases of the flu. China has banned pork from some of those states. [ID:nN2818017]

"We think the market has priced in most of the swine flu-related news for now, unless there are deaths in the United States," said Rich Nelson, livestock analyst with Allendale Inc.
