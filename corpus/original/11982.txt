(Reuters) - CITIC Securities Co (
), China's biggest listed brokerage, posted a 3.6 percent rise in second-quarter profit as a rally in the domestic stock market boosted commission income and investment returns.
Net profit during the April-June period rose to 2.33 billion yuan from 2.25 billion yuan a year earlier, according to calculations from half-year results.
For the first half, profit fell 20 percent to 3.83 billion yuan from 4.77 billion yuan a year earlier, the Beijing-based brokerage said in a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Revenue fell 18 percent to 8.95 billion yuan in the first half from 10.91 billion yuan in the year-ago period.
CITIC Securities and other Chinese brokerages benefited from a 60 percent surge in the domestic stock market during the first half, but suffered from a 10-month ban on initial public offerings that ended in June.
Going forward, CITIC Securities may benefit from continuous strength in the stock market, a flood of IPOs, its nascent private equity business and further financial innovations including index futures, margin trading and short selling, analysts said.
CITIC shares rose 0.49 percent to 32.56 yuan in Shanghai on Friday, ahead of the results, compared with a 2.98 percent drop in the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index
