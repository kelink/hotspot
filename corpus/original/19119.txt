(Reuters) - Hong Kong confirmed Asia's first case of the H1N1 flu in a Mexican traveller on Friday, prompting authorities to seal off the hotel where the patient was staying.
He had a fever and went to Ruttonjee Hospital for help on Thursday evening, Tsang said. The Mexican is now in hospital in a stable condition.
"I assure you the Hong Kong government will try its best to conquer the virus," Tsang said. "At the present moment, I would prefer to do it more stringently instead of missing the opportunity to control the spread of the virus."
The affluent financial hub on the south coast of China is widely seen as one of the best-prepared Asian cities to deal with swine flu, given its experience in handling sporadic outbreaks of H5N1 avian flu, as well as SARS in 2003 which killed 299 people.
But before he could get admitted to hospital, he had infected eight people in a lift lobby of a hotel where he was staying. Some of them then went on to spread the disease in Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada and Vietnam.
To tackle the H1N1 flu virus, Hong Kong authorities have beefed up surveillance at airports and hospitals, improved public health response systems and stockpiled over 20 million doses of the anti-influenza drug Tamiflu. (Reporting by Donny Kwok, writing by Tan Ee Lyn; editing by XXX)
