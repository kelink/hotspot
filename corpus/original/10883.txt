(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures pointed to a lower open on Monday as Chinese equities dropped sharply and commodities fell on concerns that asset prices have run ahead of the economic realities.
Financial shares also pulled back after a recent rally, with American International Group Inc (
) falling nearly 10 percent, and Barron's recommending investors take profits in Citigroup Inc (
), which dropped 3 percent before the bell.
"It (China) is weighing on our market open," said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co in San Francisco. Pado said he expects the market to consolidate heading into the traditionally weak month of September.
S&P 500 futures SPc1 fell 7.4 points and were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 lost 76 points and Nasdaq 100 futures NDc1 dropped 13.75 points.
Traders cited the sell-off in Chinese equities for a fall in the price of oil and other commodities. Oil dropped 3 percent to below $71 a barrel, and metals prices slid.
In New York, shares in natural resource companies sold off before the bell. Exxon Mobil Corp (
) said it will buy smaller competitor BJ Services Co BJS.N for $5.5 billion in stock and cash, sending BJ's shares up 11.5 percent to $17.20 before the bell [ID:nBNG500189]
