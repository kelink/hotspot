Japan to urge China for bigger CO2 cut target: media

(Reuters) - Japan is expected to urge China to toughen its carbon intensity target at a Copenhagen climate conference starting next week, the Nikkei business daily reported on Thursday.
Japan is also likely to press the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter at the U.N.-led December 7-18 talks to set a year for when emissions will peak, the Nikkei reported, without citing sources.
China unveiled last week its first firm target to curb greenhouse gas emissions, setting a target for carbon intensity, which is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted for each unit of economic output.
But with China's emissions still likely to double by 2020 with the new target, Japan sees the goal as insufficient to curb the effects of global warming, the Nikkei said.
Japan, the world's fifth largest emitter, has pledged to target a 25 percent cut in emissions from 1990 levels by 2020, but only on condition of a deal on ambitious goals being agreed by major emitters, including China.
Japan has also said it is ready to offer a substantial sum of funds to help developing countries fight climate change, but has yet to specify how much in additional money it will offer.
