(Reuters) - Industrialized and developing nations are finding more common ground on climate change issues although significant disagreements remain, the top U.S. environmental diplomat said on Tuesday after two days of high-level talks.
"There are still significant differences between the parties but the discussions in this group continue to be very good," said Todd Stern, the U.S. special envoy on climate change, after a meeting of environmental officials from 17 major global economies in the resort town of Jiutepec outside of Mexico City.
The group's final communique made no mention of concrete commitments, saying only that many countries agreed there should be a "global long-term goal by 2050 in the context of a specific developed country 2050 (emissions) goal."
The world needs to cut emissions of greenhouse gases by 25 to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 if the worst effects of climate change are to be avoided, according to the United Nations' Climate Panel.
"The level of 40 percent below 1990 levels is in our judgment not necessary and not feasible," Stern said.
Stern downplayed these concerns, noting that it would be unusual for a treaty on a topic as complex as climate change to be finished months ahead of schedule.
The leaders of the member nations of the Major Economies Forum are due to meet on the sidelines of the G8 Summit in L'Aquila, Italy on July 9 to continue discussions over climate policy. (Reporting by Robert Campbell; Editing by Eric Walsh)
