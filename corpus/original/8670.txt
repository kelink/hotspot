(Reuters) - French nuclear group Areva CEPFi.PA will form a nuclear engineering and design joint venture with a Chinese counterpart before the end of this year, a company executive said on Monday.
"We will very soon sign an agreement with the Chinese nuclear industry to join our engineering and design forces," Marc Andolenko, president of Areva's China unit told reporters on the sidelines of an industry forum in Beijing.
Areva has been trying to build their business in China after losing out to Toshiba Corp's (
) Westinghouse Electric in the bid to supply the country's first third generation nuclear power plant.
Westinghouse's AP1000 technology will form the basis of China's own third generation reactor after the two sides signed a technology transfer agreement, and Avera's designs were rejected after it refused to transfer the technology.
