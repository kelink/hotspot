Australian national Stern Hu and three Chinese employees of the Anglo-Australian company -- Liu Caikui, Ge Minqiang, and Wang Yong -- are suspected of "using improper means to obtain commercial secrets about our country's steel businesses", Xinhua cited prosecutors in Shanghai as saying.
The report said the procuratorate, or state prosecutors, also approved their formal arrest on suspicion of taking bribes.
"The procuratoratial organ conducted investigations and believes that it has evidence that the four, including Stern Hu, are suspected of the above crimes," said the report.
Rio Tinto had no immediate response to the report, but it has previously said that the four detained employees did nothing improper.
