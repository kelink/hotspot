(Reuters) - A senior Chinese diplomat arrived in Tehran on Sunday to discuss Iran's nuclear program, amid differences between China and the West over how to resolve the dispute it has caused.
The semi-official ISNA news agency said China's assistant foreign minister, Ma Zhaoxu, met a member of the Supreme Council of National security, Ali Baqeri, for talks on Iran's stalled nuclear talks with six world powers, as well as bilateral ties.
The agency quoted Ma as saying China was interested in accelerating talks between Iran and the P5+1 group, comprising the United States, France, Germany, China, Russia and Britain.
Tensions rose last month when EU leaders agreed to embargo Iranian oil and put in place further measures against Iran's central bank. China is one of the largest users of Iranian oil, buying around one fifth of total exports.

Of course China is visiting Iran¡­once Iran nukes the whole world around them it gives the Chinese an unlimited supply of oil. And of course the Soviets are in on that too. Go Israel¡­stop this problem before it starts!!This year¡¯s ¡°Arab Spring¡± may take on a whole new meaning.
