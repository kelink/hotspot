World stocks' near-50 percent gain since early March may be leveling off -- investors have factored in much of the output recovery that is in the pipeline and fresh impetus could be needed from further improvements in economic indicators or the corporate outlook. With many fund managers yet to wade in with the cash piles on which they have been sitting, a bout of volatility looks more likely than a dramatic pullback. UK political ructions, emerging market flashpoints, looming TARP repayment all offer plenty of scope for such swings.
Talk of green shoots of economic recovery has removed some of the threat of global economic meltdown and therefore reduced the pressure to come up with coordinated international policy response. The Lecce finance ministers' meeting will test G8 nations' commitment to putting up extra money for the IMF and an SDR allocation increase. The risk is that cracks appear on these and other issues (eg QE, fiscal stimulus, etc). Given expanded IMF resourcing was one of the planks on which the equity market/emerging market rebound was built, any signs of pullback could fuel volatility and throw up risks for the assets which have benefited most from that rally.
Asian reserve managers' reassurance on Treasuries holdings came in the same week as rumblings of discomfort from some emerging market countries (eg South Africa, Israel) on the dollar's slide and its fallout. Soothing noises from Asia about their dollar-denominated holdings and its FX impact risks being canceled out by the chatter about international reserve currencies building in the run-up to the first BRIC summit later in June. It will be particularly interesting to see how China squares its position on holding onto dollar reserves with its previous contributions to the international reserves debate.
Strong demand for long-dated German and UK debt helped reverse part of the recent yield curve steepening. Fed, ECB and market watchers are having a hard time disentangling how much of that steepening was down to economic activity pick up expectations and how much should be attributed to issuance, longer-term price pressure concerns. The market's appetite to absorb more long-dated paper (from U.S. and Japan next week) will shed more light on how soon central banks might have to fret about longer-term borrowing costs backing up.
