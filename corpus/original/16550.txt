"It's going to be unpopular with almost everyone," said Tasneem Essop, of WWF International, of the blueprint issued on the sidelines of 181-nation U.N. talks in Bonn about a U.N. pact to be agreed in December in Copenhagen.
"But we need more ambitious targets," she told Reuters of the draft, written by almost 50 leading environmentalists and with the backing of groups including WWF, Greenpeace, Germanwatch and the David Suzuki Foundation.
"Climate change is the most important issue facing the planet and its people today," the text begins. Curbs outlined in the 42-page draft are much tougher than those on offer at the June 1-12 meeting, by either rich and poor countries.
And it called on industrialized countries to raise at least $160 billion a year from 2013-2017, mainly via auctioning of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions allowances, to help developing nations cope with climate change.
"It could be motivating to delegates to give them a vision," said Bill Hare of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research who worked for many years for Greenpeace. "There are quite heavy commitments required of the major emitters."
The proposal said that all rich nations should work out zero carbon action plans, or "z-caps" to cut emissions, relative to 1990 levels, by 40 percent by 2020 and by at least 95 percent by 2050. Developing nations' emissions should peak before 2020.
By contrast, U.S. President Barack Obama's goals are less ambitious -- he wants to cut U.S. emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and by 80 percent below by 2050. U.S. emissions were 14 percent above 1990 levels in 2007.
China and many developing nations have not set a peak year for emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels that are blamed by a U.N. panel of scientists for stoking warming set to cause more heat waves, droughts, floods and more powerful storms.
The proposals would also widen binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to newly industrialized countries -- such as Singapore, South Korea and Saudi Arabia. They are exempt from caps under the existing Kyoto Protocol.
