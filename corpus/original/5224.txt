(Reuters) - Japan unveiled a sweeping update of its defense policies on Friday, its first major revision in six years, as the country faces China's military build-up and North Korea's nuclear ambitions.
Following are key points from the National Defense Program Guideline, which lays out Japan's basic defense policy for the next 10 years, and the Mid-Term Defense Program, the Defense Ministry's "shopping list" for the next five years.
-- Sees China's rising military spending, rapid modernization of its armed forces, growing maritime activities and lack of transparency as "a matter of concern"
-- Regards North Korea's nuclear and missile programs and its aggressive acts as "a present and grave destabilizing factor"
-- Considers security alliance with the United States as "indispensable" for Japan's peace and safety
-- Aims to lessen the burden on Okinawa, where U.S. bases are concentrated, while maintaining U.S. military deterrent
-- Seeks to strengthen ties with South Korea, Australia, India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
-- Expects to make its armed forces more mobile, flexible and responsive to better cope with changing security environment
-- Plans to strengthen its defense posture in the southwest, where it shares a maritime border with China, with more troops and combat aircraft
-- Will not ease weapons export ban for now, but is leaving the door open for Japanese defense contractors to take part in
-- Plans to review the five principles of Japan's participation in U.N. peace keeping operations. Some of the preconditions such as on truces between warring parties can sometimes be too difficult to meet, the ruling Democratic Party of Japan has said.
BUDGET, PROCUREMENT
-- Has Earmarked 23.49 trillion yen ($280 billion) for defense spending for the five years from next April, down 3 percent from a five-year spending cap to March 2010 amid budget constraints
-- To cut army headcount by 1,000 to 154,000 and reduce the number of tanks by a third to 400 as part of a shift of resources to navy and air forces
-- Will raise number of submarines to 22 from 16, and number of warships fitted with the Aegis ballistic missile defense systems to six from four
