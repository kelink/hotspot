(Reuters) - Following are some of the main points in agreements resulting from a meeting of foreign ministers from the 45 members of the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in Hanoi on Monday and Tuesday:
-- The ministers condemned North Korea's nuclear test, calling it a clear violation of relevant United Nations resolutions and six-party talks agreements. Also called on Pyongyang to refrain from future atomic tests and return to talks hosted by China.
-- The ministers called for the early release of detainees in Myanmar, noting concern over the trial of Aung San Suu Kyi, and urged the ruling junta to lift restrictions on political parties in Myanmar.
-- The ministers agreed economic growth prospects for developed and developing countries had deteriorated in 2009, and the current crisis could go deeper in some places. It was possible for the world economy to start recovering in 2010 "with concerted efforts through close coordination and cooperation".
-- The ministers agreed the international community needed to "enhance open and equitable multilateral trade and financial systems", by rejecting protectionism, enhancing market access for exports of developing countries and promoting regional and inter-regional integration.
-- They agreed protectionist measures could provoke retaliation, further harm the world economy and delay its recovery.
-- They called on all countries to intensify efforts for an "ambitious, comprehensive and balanced" conclusion to the Doha Development Agenda.
-- They supported enhancing cooperation in and promoting good governance and transparency of international organisations such as the IMF, World Bank, and international forums such as the G20.
--They expressed concern over the fluctuation of commodity prices worldwide, especially oil and food, and said they posed a serious challenge to stable growth, and committed to joint measures to address the crisis.
-- Ministers noted the adverse impact of climate change, the risks of glaciers melting and sea level rises.
-- They also affirmed strengthened cooperation in ASEM to enable the Copenhagen conference on climate change in December to reach an "ambitious, effective and comprehensive agreed outcome".
-- They emphasised that developed countries had to take the lead on emissions reduction, and urged them to propose ambitious, economy-wide, mid-term and long-term targets well ahead of the Copenhagen meeting. AFGHANISTAN -- Ministers stressed their commitment to the promotion of peace, stability and development in Afghanistan. (Reporting by John Ruwitch; Editing by Bill Tarrant)
