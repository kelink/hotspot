) raised HK$1.1 billion ($141.9 million) via a two-tranche sale of domestic bonds as part of its new medium-term note programme, sole lead manager HSBC said on Monday.
The gas distributor, widely known as Towngas, sold HK$500 million in 10-year notes at a coupon of 3.90 percent and HK$600 million in 15-year notes at a coupon of 4.25 percent, said HSBC via a spokeswoman.
The offering is the first sale to come from Towngas' new US$1 billion medium-term note (MTN) programme, which allows issuers flexibility and speed in issuing new debt.
Towngas, a frequent issuer in debt capital markets, intends to use the money raised to refinance existing debt, fund capital spending and for other general corporate purposes.
The MTN programme was rated "A-plus" by Standard & Poor's, or the fifth-highest investment-grade rating, and an equivalent "A1" by Moody's Investors Service.
