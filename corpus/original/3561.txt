China's CNOOC hit by fresh oil spill in northern waters: report

(Reuters) - China's biggest offshore oil producer, CNOOC, has been hit by another oil spill in north Chinese waters, state media reported on Saturday, following a June spill at a field jointly run with ConocoPhillips that sparked an official uproar.
The latest spill broke out near the Jingzhou 9-3 field operated by a subsidiary of CNOOC in the Liaodong Bay off northeast China, Xinhua news agency reported.
Maritime administrators announced an emergency and have sent a ship to the area after a belt of oil floated to the surface near a platform on the field on Friday. A construction ship struck an underground pipeline, the report said.
Liaodong Bay is part of the bigger Bohai Bay, where CNOOC and its U.S. partner ConocoPhillips have been struggling with a spill in June that triggered government demands for tougher regulation of offshore oil operations.
The leak from the Conoco-operated Penglai 19-3 oilfield released less oil in three months than BP's Gulf of Mexico spewed out in a single day, but the response from Beijing was vehement.
Last month, authorities ordered the shutdown of the 168,000 barrels-per-day field, in which state-run CNOOC owns 51 percent.
CNOOC cut its output target, though the production loss is seen as having only a minor impact on supplies to the world's No.5 crude producer.
