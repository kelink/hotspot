(Reuters) - China denied discrimination lay behind its confinement of scores of Mexican nationals over fears of the H1N1 flu, urging Mexico to respond calmly and cooperate in fighting the virus.
Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa on the weekend accused China of discriminating against his country's citizens after Beijing ordered dozens of them into isolation in hotels and other sites across the country, although only one, a man now in Hong Kong, has been found to have the H1N1 flu.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu rejected the criticism, saying the isolation steps were correct procedure, not bigotry.
"The measures concerned are not directed at Mexican citizens and there is no discrimination," Ma said in a statement issued on the ministry website (www.mfa.gov.cn).
"This was purely a medical quarantine issue," Ma said, adding that Mexico should "give full understanding to the measures adopted by China and handle this matter objectively and calmly".
Mexico's ambassador to Beijing, Jorge Guajardo, went to a hotel in the capital on Sunday where more than 10 Mexicans have been held, but was not allowed to see them, an embassy official said that day.
Mexicans were being held in hotels and other sites across several parts of China, including Hong Kong, said the embassy official.
China's vast population and patchy medical infrastructure make it particularly vulnerable should the virus take hold.
Many of the confined Mexicans were on that same flight to Shanghai, but others had reached China on flights from Los Angeles, Newark and Vancouver, said the embassy official.
