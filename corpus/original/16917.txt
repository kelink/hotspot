(Reuters) - British clothing retailer New Look is taking market share from rivals Marks & Spencer Group Plc (
) as cash-strapped shoppers flock to its cheaper, fast-changing fashions, it said on Wednesday.
"We're very close to a deal in Ukraine and very close to a deal in Poland. So I'd expect those deals to be ... signed in ... the next few months," Chief Executive Carl McPhail said in a telephone interview. [ID:nL32572]
New Look, bought in 2004 by private equity firms Apax [APAX.UL] and Permira [PERM.UL] along with founder Tom Singh, said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 10.2 percent to 217.6 million pounds ($361.3 million) in the year ended March 28.
Sales grew 14.9 percent to 1.32 billion pounds, including a 1.4 percent rise in like-for-like sales in the UK and Ireland.
But McPhail said like-for-like sales in the UK and Ireland had recently picked up from the 2.8 percent reported over Christmas, helped by strong demand for dresses, gladiator sandals, boyfriend cardigans and boob tubes.
) and Peacock, New Look has been taking market share from higher-priced rivals as recession-hit shoppers seek to save money.
"We're still 20 to 30 percent cheaper than the mid-market -- the likes of Next and M&S -- on an average basket. That is very appealing to some of their customers and you can see we're gaining market share, McPhail said.
In March, Marks & Spencer reported a 4.8 percent drop in like-for-like general merchandise sales, which includes clothing. Next said last month underlying sales at its shops fell 2.3 percent in the 14 weeks to May 2. [ID:nLI426587] [ID:nL6061917]
New Look said it had increased market share in womenswear by 0.7 percentage points to 5.4 percent. Its performance was also boosted by the quick turnaround of its fashions, McPhail said.
New Look, Britain's biggest retailer of women's footwear, dresses and denim, plans to add 250,000 square feet of selling space this financial year in the UK and Ireland, creating about 1,800 jobs. It currently has 3.67 million square feet of space, or 612 shops, in its home market.
The group also said it planned to open 23 stores in France and Belgium this financial year, as well as to extend its franchise businesses in the Middle East and Russia.
New distribution hubs in Singapore and Turkey, which start operations this year, will allow the group to expand in eastern Europe, China and India over coming years, McPhail added. (Editing by Kate Holton and David Holmes) ($1=.6022 Pound)
