(Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 3 percent on Monday, lifted by word of fresh rebel attacks on oil installations in Nigeria and gains in equity markets.
Nigeria's main militant group said its fighters had attacked an oil facility belonging to Royal Dutch Shell (
) in the Niger Delta on Monday, days after President Umaru Yar'Adua proposed an amnesty.
"Anytime that we see the Dow Jones higher, the funds take that as a sign that the economy is going to strengthen and that oil demand will strengthen along with that," said Peter Beutel, president of Cameron Hanover in New Canaan, Connecticut.
Signs of a turnaround in the global economy have helped lift crude prices up from below $40 a barrel in February. The economic crisis has battered global fuel demand, knocking crude off record highs set above $147 a barrel last year.
The U.S. Energy Information Administration revised up its April U.S. oil demand estimate by 1.18 percent, though the data showed consumption was still 6.56 percent lower than a year ago.
The data came after an International Energy Agency mid-term oil forecast which said that there was a chance of an extended economic contraction and that the threat of a supply crunch had only receded, not gone away.
No. 2 oil consumer China, meanwhile, unexpectedly increased gasoline and diesel prices on Monday by nearly 9 percent and 10 percent respectively.
Ongoing attacks in the OPEC nation have shut about 1.26 million bpd of oil production, with current output now around 1.74 million bpd, according to government figures.
Qatar's oil minister Abdullah al Attiyah said that he does not see any need for OPEC to increase output when it meets in September.
Algerian Energy and Mines Minister Chakib Khelil said that an increase in OPEC oil production was hard to envisage, despite rising crude prices.
A Reuters poll of analysts ahead of weekly inventory data forecast U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 1.6 million barrels last week, while gasoline stocks were seen up 2 million barrels and distillate stocks rose 1.5 million barrels. <EIA/S>
The American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly U.S. inventory on Tuesday, while the U.S. Energy Information Administration report is due out on Wednesday.
