The U.S. Agriculture Department said in a statement after pit trading had closed -- but when Globex trading was in progress -- that the pigs as well as caretakers had fully recovered from the flu, the first detected in a U.S. commercial herd.
"It's a nonevent," said Jim Clarkson, livestock analyst with A&A Trading Inc.
"It's strong technically. Funds still get involved the first (trading day) of the month with new money coming into the market," said James Burns, independent hog trader. "There was also a lack of bad news. Everything is just kind of firm."
Hog futures have been on an upswing since news last week that China will soon lift its ban on U.S. pork and word that African Swine Fever, a deadly hog disease, was spreading in Russia. [ID:nN28314175] [ID:nN29341577]
Live cattle futures also rallied late, but their run-up was attributed to cash cattle unexpectedly trading on a Monday.
Cash cattle traded steady at $88 per cwt in Texas and that sparked short-covering demand that lifted futures from early mixed trade. Although steady cash trade had been expected this week as cash cattle were seen topping, cattle trading on a Monday instead of later in the week surprised the market.
Last week, cash cattle traded higher at $87 to $88 per cwt in the southern Plains, and at $86 to $87 on a live basis and $135 on a dressed basis in Nebraska.
Feeder cattle futures also moved higher along with other commodities, especially with some support being encouraged by the ability of traders to buy feeder futures and hedge them at a profit in deferred live cattle futures.
