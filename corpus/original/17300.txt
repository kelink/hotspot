FACTBOX-Rich nations' greenhouse cuts, funding ideas

(Reuters) - About 170 nations will meet in Bonn for talks on a new climate treaty from June 1-12, with discussions expected to range from cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to ways of raising funds to help poor nations cope with global warming.
Rich nations' plans to reduce emissions by 2020 as part of a new U.N. treaty due to be agreed in Copenhagen in December work out as an overall cut of between 9 and 16 percent from 1990 levels -- far less than demands by developing nations:
DEVELOPED NATIONS' PLANS FOR CUTS (PERCENT):
14,021-12,926 15,336
(NOTES: Based on Reuters calculations from submissions to U.N. Climate Change Secretariat. Goals range from approved plans to options under consideration -- U.S. goal is President Obama's target of returning emissions to 1990 levels by 2020)
DEVELOPING NATIONS' DEMANDS OF THE RICH BY 2020: China, India, others at least 40 percent below 1990 43 small island states at least 45 percent below 1990
A 2007 report said industrialised nations as a group should reduce their emissions by between 25 and 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 to avoid the worst of global warming such as droughts, floods, heatwaves and rising sea levels.
It said developing nations should slow their rising emissions with a "substantial deviation" below projected growth by 2020. The European Union, for instance, wants them to cut by 15-30 percent below projected growth rates.
It proposes raising at least $10 billion a year, determined by criteria such as historic and current greenhouse gas emissions, population and gross domestic product.
Poor nations with low emissions, such as in Africa, would be the main recipients.
Funds could go to energy efficiency, renewable energy, green buildings, low-emission vehicles, projects to safeguard forests, better management of farming and sustainable production of biofuels. The system, to be run by a new international group, might be linked to carbon markets.
