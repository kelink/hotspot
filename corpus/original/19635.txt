CCB was expected to say results fell by about 18 percent, the average forecast of analysts at Macquarie and UBS showed.
Its net interest income, mainly driven by lending, reached 50.9 billion yuan in the first quarter, down 6.6 percent, while fee and commission income was 11.8 billion, up 10.4 percent.

CCB's Hong Kong-listed shares rose 4 cents to HK$4.42 on Friday. The shares have risen 3.3 percent so far this year through Thursday, trailing a 5.7 percent gain on the benchmark Hang Seng Index
