Below are highlights of her address, which comes roughly two weeks after she was sworn in for a second term as head of a centre-right coalition of her conservatives and the business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP).
"We would never allow the worldwide financial and economic crisis to be a cheap excuse for failing to protect the environment, that would be the biggest error we could make.
"We are still a long way from a sustainable stewardship of our global resources: so far we haven't got a global, long-term and reliable agreement on either energy or the environment.
"The old government decided on a strategic investor for Opel with good cause, to give it a new future. If we hadn't done this, there would be no Opel today, because GM could not fulfil its responsibility towards Opel as mother company for months.
"I greatly regret the decision of GM. But the workers of Opel need more than our regret, they need a concrete solution, a solution that offers job security ..
"This solution can only work if GM takes over the lion's share of the restructuring costs, which also means that it has to pay back the bridging loan."
"Joblessness has risen and will rise further, and it is only thanks to "Kurzarbeit" (a government subsidy scheme that encourages companies to reduce the hours of their workers) that more jobs were not lost. Therefore we will extend the "Kurzarbeit" scheme."
