METALS-Copper steady, stocks drop offsets economic worries

(Reuters) - Copper drifted lower on Tuesday, pressured by demand concerns as Chinese buying tailed off and economic uncertainty troubled global markets, but falling inventories helped the metal pare some early losses.
Copper for three-months delivery MCU3 on the London Metal Exchange traded at $4,974.75 a tonne at 0911 GMT, from a close of $4,970 on Monday. The metal used in power and construction hit a session low of $4,900, having reached a near-two-week low of $4,842.25 the day before.
"We're going into the quieter summer period and there's a widespread belief that Chinese imports are going to be lower in these couple of months for most of the (industrial) metals," said Stephen Briggs, commodity strategist at RBS Global Banking and Markets.
Stockpiling by China, the world's top copper consumer, has helped copper prices surge more than 60 percent so far this year. But analysts warn China's buying exercise is fading and Western economies remain too beleaguered to pick up the baton.
Copper pared earlier losses as data showed inventories dropped 3,250 tonnes to 265,925 tonnes, allaying some concerns about stocks potentially rising in a weak period for demand.
Dampening sentiment, a research group said the U.S. job market weakened in June after rebounding in May for the first time in 21 months, reaffirming that employment has yet to reach a bottom, while a report said the U.S. service sector was still shrinking in June, albeit at a lower pace.

A light economic calendar this week could keep metals prices in a tight range, analysts and traders said.
The main influence will probably be China trade data for June, likely to be released on Friday.
"With rising inventories and weaker domestic price premiums, if the Chinese June data supports the view that domestic demand is beginning to ebb, then this downward trend could be more sustained," Barclays Capital said in a note.

Tin MSN3 was at $14,350 from $14,250. The metal is in a backwardation -- premium for cash material over the three-months contract -- of $85.
Investors are showing increasing concern about the scale of long positions developing in the tin market, compared with the amount of available metal stored in London Metal Exchange warehouses.
Such worries centre on the September-December 2009 contracts, where a large number of positions were built up last week. [ID:nL6246168]
