Taiwan in final review of AIG's stalled Nan Shan deal

(Reuters) - Taiwan regulators said on Friday they had started a final review of the stalled $2.2 billion deal for AIG's Nan Shan Life unit, as the buyer group led by China Strategic had submitted all required paperwork.
The move suggested that AIG will soon learn the fate of the Nan Shan sale, after the U.S. firm and the group made concessions several times in their push to break a deadlock that has stalled it for nearly 10 months.
"We kept on submitting supplementary papers and have now formally submitted all information required (by the regulator)," Raymond Or, chief executive of Hong Kong-based China Strategic, told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission, the top financial regulator, has begun its final review upon receiving the documents, said an official.
The official, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the matter, said a decision would be made "as soon as possible," but no timetable was set.
"We hope (the buyers) have made the most clear explanations in the paperwork this time," said Fang Liang-tung, executive secretary of the Investment Commission, which oversees the island's inbound investments.
American International Group has not been able to seal the deal since October, amid concerns in Taiwan over the buyer group's political connections with China, lack of expertise in the insurance business and ability to raise funds.
Shares of China Strategic soared nearly 4 percent in afternoon trading in Hong Kong, beating the Hang Seng Index.
AIG is under pressure to complete the deal after the collapse of its planned $35.5 billion sale of its Asian life assets to Britain's Prudential.
Nan Shan has more than 4 million policyholders, nearly one-sixth of Taiwan's population.
