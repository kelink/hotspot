PRECIOUS-Gold extends gains, but capped at $890/oz

(Reuters) - Gold edged up on Tuesday, helped by light physical buying after a sharp rise a day earlier when worries over the health of the U.S. banking sector dragged down equities and enhanced gold's safe-haven appeal.
But it was capped around $890 per ounce as traders were unsure if the upward momentum led by short-term investors was sustainable, preferring to see how European and U.S. equities performed before taking bigger positions.
The yellow metal's failure to break above $900 recently shows that demand from investors and industry and jewellery buyers may be weakening.
On the other hand, gold has held above its 200-day moving average of $855.20, suggesting it still has momentum.

But the holdings fell 21.7 tonnes, or nearly 2 percent, on Thursday and Friday, when the Dow rallied to two-month highs.
Naomi Suzuki, a senior analyst at SC Asset Management Co, said the two-day sell-off was double India's gold imports in the first 15 days of April, which had been sharply up from zero in March.
"The only reason that gold fell was the massive sell-off in the ETF, if it weren't for that the market would have gained ground," Suzuki said.
Investment demand had helped send gold to above $1,000 an ounce in late February, after which bullion fell 14 percent to a three-month low of $864 marked late last week.
But Suzuki added that renewed investor risk aversion this week was supporting gold. "When stocks are down and market volatility is up like it is now, it's natural for investors to grow cautious about selling," she said.
In Asia, buying could continue for a while before seasonal demand from India peaks out and Japan and China enter a long holiday season at the beginning of May, traders said.
India, the world's biggest bullion consumer, celebrates the Akshaya Tritiya festival on April 27, when Hindus buy gold to encourage prosperity.
Among other precious metals, platinum and palladium stayed under pressure from renewed concerns about the banking sector and its impact on the global economy, traders said.
Spot platinum XPT= was down 0.7 percent at $1,151.50 an ounce. Spot palladium XPD= was at $222 an ounce, down 1.6 percent from New York's notional close.
