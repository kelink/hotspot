Separately, China Life expects growth in its new business value (NBV) to climb in the second half from the 10.9 percent in the first six months of the year, Chief Actuary Shirley Shao said. NBV is a key indicator to measure how much revenue an insurer is likely to receive in the future.

China Life warned of ongoing market uncertainty, after its April-June earnings fell 27 percent amid write-downs in a weak stock market.
The company's solvency ratio, which measures its ability to meet long-term payout obligations, also rose in July following a slight rebound in the stock market, said China Life Vice President Liu Jiade.
"There was a very apparent increase in our solvency ratio in July, and this is a trend that we're hopeful will continue," Liu said.
China Life's solvency ratio fell by almost a third at the end of June to 217 percent from 303 percent at the end of 2009.
