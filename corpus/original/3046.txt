(Reuters) - Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China, takes part in the New Hampshire primary election on Tuesday as he competes for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2012 election.
* Huntsman, 51, was U.S. ambassador to Beijing and speaks fluent Chinese. He was ambassador to Singapore in the early 1990s when his appointment at age 32 made him the youngest head of a U.S. diplomatic mission in a century.
* Considered a moderate Republican, Huntsman was twice elected governor of Utah. He was first chosen in 2005 and resigned during his second term to return to diplomatic service. While he was the state chief executive, Utah was named by the Pew Center as the Best Managed State in America. Huntsman backed John McCain in the 2008 presidential primary races, rather than Mitt Romney, a fellow Mormon.
* He has practically lived in New Hampshire in recent months as part of his strategy to focus on the state where he thinks he has the best chance of making an early impact. Huntsman did not compete in last week's Iowa caucuses, the first vote in the 2012 race.
* He is the eldest of nine children of Jon Huntsman Sr., a billionaire industrialist and founder of Huntsman Corp, a chemical company. Huntsman Sr. was a special assistant to former President Richard Nixon.
* Huntsman Jr. worked in the Reagan administration as a White House aide. He was a deputy U.S. Trade Representative in the George W. Bush administration. As U.S. trade ambassador, Huntsman negotiated agreements for the United States with China, Taiwan, Singapore, South Africa and other Asian and African nations.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Another fact you may want to keep in mind when considering Huntsman. ¨C Huntsman did not get on the ballot in Arizona as reported yesterday. In addition, he is not on the ballots in Virginia and Illinois. It it mathematically very difficult for him to win the nomination.

If you want to cast a protest vote as a way to support his policies like ¡®Trust¡±, they come across a bit too vague to help much. America already does not trust most of Washington, so what would it help? You may do better to cast your anti-Romney vote somewhere else.
