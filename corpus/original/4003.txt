(Reuters) - Brazil's Vale (
) will not submit a new offer to top a bid by China's Jinchuan Group to acquire South African-listed miner Metorex MTXJ.J, Vale and Metorex said on Monday.
Metorex said it would pay Vale a 75.2 million rand ($11.2 million) break fee to terminate the agreement. Jinchuan had added around 20 percent to the Vale bid, offering over $1.3 billion for the copper and cobalt producer.
"The board has received written notice from Vale that it does not intend to submit an amended Vale offer," Metorex said in a statement.
Vale confirmed in a separate statement it had agreed to terminate the deal, subject to payment of the break-up fee, and was focused on existing mining projects and investments elsewhere in Africa.
"Vale has no intention to match the terms of the recently announced (Jinchuan) offer for Metorex," it said.
Metorex's share price was down 2.2 percent in early trade at 8.49 rand. The Jinchuan offer is a cash bid of 8.90 rand per share. Vale shares slid 1 percent to 45.62 reais ($28.91) early in Sao Paulo's Bovespa stock trading session.
The battle for the group is the latest saga in the scramble for African resources by emerging market giants China and Brazil, which have an insatiable appetite for raw materials to fuel their growth.
This will remove the costs and political risks associated with operating in South Africa, which include compliance with a mining charter aimed at putting more ownership into the hands of previously disadvantaged blacks, union militancy and nationalization talk by radical elements of the ruling party.
