(Reuters Life!) - Caribbean cruises, Las Vegas, China, Latin America and South Africa could offer the best holiday deals in 2010 as tourists look for bargains, according to a global Internet media company.
"Our travel intentions survey reported that an overwhelming majority of people will need a deal to travel in 2010," said Gabe Saglie, a senior editor at the company.
"Not to mention these 'floating hotels' bundle several islands and all meals into one itinerary, eliminating the need for multiple airfares and hotels," the company said.
Countries in Latin America, particularly Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Panama, where the U.S. dollar goes a long way also offer bargains and airlines are adding flights to these countries.
China also has favorable exchange rates to the dollar and there are deals to be had as hotels, which added to their inventory for the 2008 Summer Olympics, are offering bargains on luxury hotel rooms, according to the company.
"The grand opening of the $8.5 billion CityCenter in December 2009 will create another 6,000-plus rooms to fill and even more deals to be had going into 2010," Travelzoo added.
South Africa will host the FIFA World Cup from June 11 to July 11 which will draw soccer fans to the country, but even for those not interested in the sport, safari companies and hotels are putting together packages to lure tourists.
"Additionally, the cost of living in the country is low, allowing the U.S. dollar to go a long way. Sit-down lunch can easily cost just $2," the company said.
