(Reuters) - Following are selected quotes from speakers at the Reuters Middle East Investment Summit, being held in Dubai, Riyadh, Manama, Doha and Cairo through October 28.
STUART PEARCE, CEO, QATAR FINANCIAL Center AUTHORITY
"We've learnt that financial institutions will always do something silly and that the herd effect is still there. One of the biggest lessons is don't assume that someone is looking after you. That's not always the case."
MICHAEL HUEBENER, CFO, EMIRATES CAPITAL
"I would love a world without rules, so I can define my own."
KHURAM MAQSOOD, MANAGING DIRECTOR, EMIRATES CAPITAL
MUSTAFA ABDEL-WADOOD, MANAGING DIRECTOR, ABRAAJ CAPITAL
"This has been an extraordinary year, things fell off a cliff overnight."
"I don't think we are, still, in a very pretty place regionally or globally, but there is better visibility."
Corporate governance "is nowhere near where it needs to be, but it's moving in the right direction."
"If I'm a large company listed in Dubai and my stock is going to go up regardless, so I'm not going to meet with analysts. I actually find it shameful that such a company would not meet with analysts -- then don't be a public company. You don't have a choice if you choose to open up your investor base to shareholders."
SHAFQAT MALIK, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, ALDAR PROPERTIES
"You have to plan, plan, plan for every eventuality."
"It's not all doom and gloom. There is business, there is a market."
HOWARD HANDY, CHIEF ECONOMIST, SAMBA
SIMON COOPER, DEPUTY CHAIRMAN AND CEO, HSBC BANK MIDDLE EAST
On the biggest danger as the economy recovers: "Over-enthusiasm." "I wouldn't like to see floods of speculative investment"
JEAN-PAUL MOLLIE, MIDDLE EAST, SOUTH ASIA & AFRICA REGIONAL
