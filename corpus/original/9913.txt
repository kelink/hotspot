(Reuters) - The Chinese city of Harbin has given up on its plan to bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics after the central government said it was "premature", local officials said on Wednesday.
The application by the northern metropolis was declined by China's General Administration of Sport (GAS) late last month, an official in the city's sports bureau said.
"GAS suggested Harbin not launch the bid for the 2018 Winter Games because there was very little chance of success," Li Chunlei, told Reuters by telephone.
Harbin, the capital city of Heilongjiang province, is keen to host China's first Winter Games but failed to make the shortlist for the 2010 Games, which will take place in Vancouver.
"We had failed a bid of the 2010 Games. A second failure in succession would harm our future chances," Li added.
In September, sports minister Liu Peng said GAS would back a bid from any enthusiastic city.
A GAS workgroup to inspect the preparation was sent to Harbin in late August, but they later advised the city did not yet have the conditions to host a Winter Olympic Games, according to Li.
Munich, South Korea's Pyeongchang and Annecy of France have all expressed interest in bidding. The 2014 Winter Games will take place in Sochi, Russia.
