(Reuters) - Energy technology firm American Superconductor Corp (
) forecast fiscal 2009 revenue below market expectations, even as it posted its first-ever quarterly profit, sending its shares down as much as 5 percent.
American Superconductor, whose key customer is China's Sinovel Wind, said it sees a drop in its fiscal 2009 backlog since it does not expect a new 1.5-megawatt order from Sinovel this year.
"Based on the aging of the backlog, we expect revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 to be flat to slightly up compared to fourth quarter fiscal 2008," Chief Financial Officer David Henry said in a conference call.
The company sees 2009 earnings of 1 cent to 3 cents a share. Excluding items, it expects to earn 27 cents to 30 cents.
Analysts on average expected the company to earn 8 cents a share, before special items, on revenue of $250.5 million for the year, according to Reuters Estimates.
"If we look at the fourth-quarter revenue, it shows that the revenue guidance for the full year is below the last quarter on an annualized basis," analyst Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James said, adding that the stock is down mainly on the revenue outlook.
Gross margin in the first quarter is expected to decline 400 to 500 basis points from the fourth-quarter levels, the company said. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 32.6 percent. American Superconductor makes power cables, surge protectors and other products to connect wind farms to the electrical grid.
The company is well positioned in China's wind market, which has been almost doubling in terms of capacity since 2004, but growth is not that visible yet in the superconductor market, analyst Vijay Singh of Janco Partners said.
For the fourth quarter ended March 31, the company posted a net income of $1.3 million, or 3 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $1.8 million, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, it earned 9 cents a share. Revenue jumped 60 percent to $61.2 million.
Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 1 cent a share, before special items, on revenue of $57.6 million.
Sinovel Wind, a state enterprise, accounted for 68 percent of the company's revenue in the fourth quarter.
American Superconductor's topline is more recession-resistant as "almost two-thirds of its revenue comes in some sense from the Chinese government," Raymond James' Molchanov said.
