), China's third-largest life insurer, plans to carry out its planned Hong Kong listing by Christmas, the official China Securities Journal said on Thursday.
The insurer, partly owned by the Carlyle Group, is in the final stages of preparing for the listing and plans to offer no more than 1 billion Hong Kong-listed H shares at no less than HK$23.52 ($3.04) per share, the newspaper reported, citing a source familiar with the situation.
"We have not yet received such information. If we receive any information, we will announce it," it quoted the official as saying.
The insurer said in July it would relaunch a Hong Kong IPO after trying to raise more than $4 billion from the Hong Kong market last year, but did not provide a detailed timeframe for the listing. [ID:nSP383297]
China Pacific hired China International Capital Corp (CICC) as the lead underwriter for the sale, sources with direct knowledge of the situation have told Reuters. [ID:nSHA309267]
The insurer said on Oct. 28 that China's securities regulator had accepted its application for a Hong Kong listing.
The China Securities Journal said that, if subsequent procedures with Hong Kong authorities go smoothly, it should be possible for the company to list on the Hong Kong exchange before the end of the year. ($1=7.749 Hong Kong Dollar) (Reporting by Edmund Klamann; Editing by Ken Wills)
