UPDATE 1-Cisco says aims to regain lost share in edge routers

(Reuters) - Top U.S. network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc (
), Australia's biggest phone company, and that it was focused on winning back some of the market share it recently lost.
Cisco said it was boosting the capacity of edge routers to help customers more easily handle web video traffic, a move it hopes will win customers away from smaller U.S. rivals like Juniper Networks JNPR.O as well as France's Alcatel-Lucent (
) and China's Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL].
"I have to acknowlege that on the edge, we've clearly lost some market share," Kelly Ahuja, senior vice president and general manager of Cisco's service provider router technology group, told analysts on a conference call.
Edge routers are used at the peripheries of a service provider's network, closer to the end user. Such equipment can ease the strain on the overall network and help stream video more efficiently since, for example, cable service customers wouldn't need to reach into the core of the network each time they choose to download a movie online.
Suraj Shetty, Cisco's vice president in charge of worldwide service provider marketing, said the deal showed Cisco was winning market share and demand for such equipment was strong despite a weaker global economy that was forcing some customers to run their networks at near full capacity.
Cisco forecast global Internet traffic to increase fivefold from 2008 to 2013, and Shetty predicted that by the end of that period around 90 percent of all consumer Internet traffic would be video.
