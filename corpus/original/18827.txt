U.S. crude settled 63 cents lower at $53.84 a barrel, after hitting a high for the year of $54.83 a barrel. London Brent fell 46 cents to settle at $54.12 a barrel.
The slumping economy has battered crude demand, driving up stockpiles and sending prices down from record highs over $147 a barrel struck in July.
Optimism that the recession could be easing has helped lift stock markets in recent weeks, sending the S&P 500 on Monday into positive territory for the year and lending support to crude prices.
"Even though oil markets are trading near highs of the year so far, the market still feels nervous about sustaining the highs. Fundamentals still don't justify prices," said Tom Bentz of BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc.
The drop in demand has swelled U.S. oil inventories to 19-year highs, and analysts polled ahead of weekly data forecast another rise in the week ending May 1.
Crude oil stockpiles rose by 2.2 million barrels, according to the poll, taken ahead of data from the American Petroleum Institute due out later Tuesday and U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) to be released on Wednesday.
Distillate inventories were seen rising by 1 million barrels, with gasoline stocks up by 700,000 barrels.
India's factory activity expanded in April for the first time in five months, according to the ABN AMRO Bank purchasing managers' index.
