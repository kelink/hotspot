(Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei is set to dip on Wednesday, with profit-taking emerging after U.S. stocks were hurt by talk of a levy on banks, disappointing results from Alcoa and news that China's central bank was tightening monetary conditions.
Shares of Alcoa Inc fell 11 percent as the aluminum company's weaker-than-expected results weighed on sentiment after investors had hoped Alcoa would kick off the latest quarterly earnings season on a positive note.
China's central bank signaled in its open market operations on Tuesday that it was tightening monetary conditions at a faster-than-expected pace in response to increasing concerns about the economy overheating.
"These factors, plus numerous technical indicators implying that the Nikkei has become a bit overheated, will lead to profit-taking today," said Hiroichi Nishi, general manager at the equity division of Nikko Cordial Securities.
Market players said the benchmark Nikkei is likely to move between 10,650 and 10,800. It closed at 10,879.14, a 15-month high, on Tuesday.
The Nikkei's relative strength index (RSI) on Tuesday rose to 72, a signal that the index is overbought, with market players saying some downward adjustment -- particularly in resource shares, which have gained recently -- is only natural.
In a sign that stocks are likely to dip, Nikkei futures traded in Chicago closed at 10,800, down 0.8 percent
Japan Airlines is unlikely to exert much of an impact on the market a day after its shares plunged 45 percent to a record low, wiping out nearly $900 million in market value, on growing expectations the airline is headed for bankruptcy and a delisting from the Tokyo exchange.
