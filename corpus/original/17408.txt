(Reuters) - Global emissions of the main greenhouse gas carbon dioxide will jump more than 39 percent by 2030 without new policies and binding pacts to cut global warming pollution, the top U.S. energy forecast agency said on Wednesday.
Without new agreements to foster emerging technologies such as solar and wind power and burial of carbon dioxide underground, world emissions of the gas should hit 40.4 billion tonnes by 2030, up from 29 billion tonnes in 2006, said the Energy Information Administration, the independent statistics arm of the Department of Energy.
"With strong economic growth and continued heavy reliance on fossil fuels expected for most of (the developing) economies, much of the increase in carbon dioxide emission is projected to occur among the developing ... nations," the EIA said in the report, its annual International Energy Outlook.
By 2030, carbon dioxide emissions from developing countries should hit 25.8 billion tonnes, while the pollution from rich countries should be 14.6 billion tonnes, the EIA said.
The United States is the world's second biggest greenhouse gas polluter behind China, but its global warming pollution on a per capita basis is nearly five times higher than China's. Developing countries say the rich countries are responsible for most of the greenhouse pollution since the Industrial Revolution. (Reporting by Timothy Gardner; editing by Jim Marshall)
