METALS-Copper up on weak dollar, economy worries remain
2009-06-18 14:42:00.0
(Reuters) - Copper prices settled a shade higher on Thursday, recovering from earlier losses with the help of a weaker dollar, but signs of significant economic improvement are still needed before higher prices can be sustained, traders and analysts said.
Copper for September delivery HGU9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division rose 1.25 cents to close at $2.2820 a lb.
On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three months MCU3 ended up $10 at $4,970 a tonne.
Data suggesting an economic and demand recovery may be in sight has boosted industrial metals in recent weeks, but reports Thursday showing U.S. manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic area contracted less severely than expected in June failed to have that same bullish effect for prices. [ID:nN18266955]
"We did not see much of a reaction, and I think it's indicative of how overdone some of these markets have gotten," said Matthew Zeman, head of trading with LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago.
"I think a lot of these market got a little ahead of themselves and, although technically we may be coming out of the recession, I think the recovery period is going to take longer than people estimated," he said.
"People are waiting for the actual concrete evidence that we have improved," Citigroup analyst David Thurtell said. "Unless we get a dramatic further improvement in some of the economic data, I think we'll just tread water."
The dollar edged lower against a basket of currencies after Thursday's U.S. data. A weaker dollar makes metals priced in the U.S. currency cheaper for other currency holders. [USD/]
Underlining concerns the global economy faces further struggles, China Minmetals Non-ferrous Metals Co Ltd said industrial metals demand will take one or two years to resume growth. [ID:nSYD384860]

STOCKPILING ISSUES Stockpiling by China, the world's top copper consumer, has also helped the metal rise by about 60 percent this year. Investors have been cheered by declining LME inventories, which fell by 1,575 tonnes to 281,600 tonnes, according to latest data. That was the lowest since mid-November and down from levels around 500,000 tonnes in February and March. Aluminum MAL3 closed at $1,642 per tonne, up from $1,622 on Wednesday. LME stocks for the metal, used in transport and packaging, jumped 12,675 tonnes to a record 4.37 million tonnes -- a reminder of weak demand for the metal. Steel ingredient nickel MNI3 was at $15,005 per tonne, versus $14,850 Wednesday, while zinc MZN3 rose to $1,563 a tonne from $1,555. Battery material lead MPB3 was at $1,675 a tonne, up from $1,661, while tin MSN3 was at $14,850 a tonne, down from $15,150. LME inventory data showed lead stocks rose 175 tonnes to 84,375 tonnes, highest since late August, while tin stocks rose 615 tonnes to 16,865 tonnes, highest since January 2006. Investors are bracing themselves for weakness in industrial metals as markets enter a traditionally quiet trading season. But some analysts see Chinese demand providing a crutch once again later in the year.
