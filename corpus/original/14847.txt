(Reuters) - Beijing will urge U.S. President Barack Obama to desist from imposing duties on Chinese tires because such a step would send a worrying signal about trade protectionism, China's commerce ministry said on Friday.
China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on its website that the recommendation "is not reasonable and lacks objective evidence, which would not only seriously hinder the normal China-U.S. tire trade but also hurt the interests of U.S. tire consumers."
Four members of the six-member U.S. trade commission recommended that Obama impose additional duties of 55 percent in the first year, 45 percent in the second year, and 35 percent in the third year on imports of passenger vehicle and light truck tires from China.
The trade commission will formally submit its recommendations to Obama in a report next month. He will then have until September to decide what, if any, action to take.
