Bird told Reuters last week that Citigroup planned to open two branches a month on average in China for the foreseeable future, the maximum allowed by regulators.
The company's strategy "is progressively more weighted to emerging markets," Bird told Reuters. "Greater China is the future."

A Citigroup spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. The company's shares were trading up less than one percent, at $3.70, by mid-afternoon.
