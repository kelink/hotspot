(Reuters) - China's mutual funds industry posted a loss of 55.43 billion yuan ($8 billion) in the third quarter, mainly hit by a 6 percent quarterly fall in the country's stock market, the official Shanghai Securities News reported on Thursday.
The loss is in stark contrast to the record quarterly profit of 346 billion yuan earned by the funds in the second quarter. China's mutual funds industry is made up of 502 funds run by 60 asset management companies, with $310 billion in client assets.
But China's funds targeting overseas markets, known as Qualified Domestic Institutional Investors (QDIIs), outperformed the industry in the third quarter by earning a combined 6.9 billion yuan, although that was less than their total profit of 15.2 billion yuan in the second quarter, the newspaper said.

That made the Chinese index underperform most major global stock markets in the third quarter after sharply outperforming them in the first half, pushing Chinese investors to redeem a net 5.08 percent of their fund units in the third quarter, the Shanghai Securities News said.
