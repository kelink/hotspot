China urges more bank loans for small firms

(Reuters) - China on Wednesday urged banks to provide more loans to smaller firms, an indication that the government wants to see credit growth so long as it is directed at sectors that are key to the overall economy.
Although the call for more lending to smaller firms was nothing new, it came after worries about monetary tightening knocked the Chinese stock market down by about 20 percent over the past two weeks.
"We will give appropriate subsidies to financial institutions to support them in extending loans to small companies," the State Council, or cabinet, said in a statement after a regular weekly meeting.
The cabinet also said that regulators would be flexible in assessing credit extended to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), hinting at giving banks more leeway for such lending.
Small, private companies have been drivers of Chinese growth and the biggest source of employment creation in recent years, but they have consistently struggled to obtain loans because banks have preferred to lend to large, government-backed firms, which are seen as posing little credit risk.
Chinese banks extended 7.73 trillion yuan ($1.1 trillion) in new loans in the first seven months of the year, or more than one-quarter of the country's gross domestic product.
The cabinet statement did not make any specific mention of the sharp market sell-off. The lack of concrete steps by Beijing to support slumping stocks has disappointed investors, harming already fragile sentiment.
Along with credit for smaller firms, the cabinet promised a range of other measures to help them.
"There have been positive signs in SME business operations, but the situation is still serious. We must launch more effective measures to help them weather the difficulties," the statement said.
