) fell as much as 13 percent on Friday, a day after the company reported a surprise third-quarter loss, mainly hurt by a steep fall in crane revenue.
The 107-year-old company, known for its crawler cranes and boom trucks, has been hit hard by weak demand for cranes as lack of credit has forced construction firms to cut capital spending on new projects.
Sales for the crane segment, which contributed about 54 percent of Manitowoc's third-quarter revenue, fell 52 percent. [ID:nBNG429643]
"I would say that we are seeing some competitive pricing," Tellock said on a conference call with analysts on Friday.
Analyst Charles Brady of BMO Capital Markets said, "it is a positive comment in a weak market that they are not seeing any kind of material pricing pressure."
"In second quarter, we saw kind of bottoming crane orders, and now on the rebound here..., and that is certainly going to continue for a couple of quarters at least," Brady, who has an "outperform" rating on the stock, said by phone.
There will be a slow recovery in late 2010 and that will turn into actual real growth in early 2011, mainly driven by various upcoming construction projects such as wind farms, said Gabelli Company analyst Heiko Ihle, who has a "buy" rating on the stock.
The heavy-lift part of the crane business is holding up really well, mainly helped by a lot of spending on infrastructure and energy in markets such as the Middle East, Brazil, China and India, analyst Brady said.
On the call, the company also said it is on track to achieve the $150 million target in cost savings in the second half of 2009.
Shares of the company, which have gained 87 percent of their value in the last three months, were down $1.31 at $9.18 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Bijoy Koyitty in Bangalore; Editing by Ratul Ray Chaudhuri)
