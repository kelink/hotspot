(Reuters) - China's number one Zheng Jie is feeling the pressure going into the Wimbledon Championships this week having raised expectations by reaching the women's singles semi-finals last year as a wild card.
The 25-year-old, who has since proved that was no fluke and is the highest-ranked Chinese player ever at world number 15, plays Kristina Barrois of Germany in the first round on Court Seven at the All England club on Monday.
"Indeed, there is a big change for me in one year and I do feel more pressure coming back here," Zheng told the China Daily. "A lot of people hope I make the semi-finals again or go even better."
Zheng is, of course, a Wimbledon champion courtesy of her 2006 women's doubles triumph with compatriot Yan Zi and the warm reception she received on her fairytale run last year has only bolstered her affection for the grasscourt grand slam.
"It is very strange China doesn't have any tennis grass courts but I am able to play my best at Wimbledon," she told the paper.
The 27-year-old, whose career has been disrupted by injury, spearheaded China's breakthrough in women's tennis with her run to the last eight three years ago, and Zheng said she hoped the pair would soon be joined by younger Chinese talents.
"It's a big accomplishment for China and we've come a long way," Zheng said. "Both of us have trained so hard because we've been sidelined for more than half a year with injuries.
"I am happy for myself and also Li Na. And I sincerely hope more Chinese youngsters will come out and show their ability, not just the 'old faces' like Li and me."
