Medal haul lifted before and after hosting Olympics

(Reuters) - Hosting the summer Olympics boosts a country's medal haul not just in the year it hosts the games but also in the competitions before and after, according to a British study published on Thursday.
The idea of a home advantage for countries hosting an Olympics is generally accepted but what is not so clear is whether an advantage exists in the games before and after, Alan Nevill of the University of Wolverhampton and colleagues said.
The study, which looked at the performance of every country which has hosted the summer Olympics since 1948, found extra money to support under-funded sports and promising athletes played a key role in explaining the reason.
"Almost all countries that have been awarded the games after World War Two would appear to have invested heavily in sport before being awarded the games," they wrote in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.
The British government invested 235 million pounds ($363.8 million) to support 27 sports in the run up to the Beijing games last year, after spending 58.9 million pounds supporting 12 sports ahead of the Sydney 2000 games, and a further 70 million pounds in the four years before the Athens games in 2004.
This is good news for Britain which hosts the next summer games, the researchers said. They predicted the country would haul in around 63 medals in 2012 while China -- which won 100 medals when hosting the 2008 games -- stands to win 78.
That would be up from the 47 medals it won in Beijing last year and the 30 medals it brought home from Athens in 2004, the researchers said.
"Based on these findings, Great Britain's prospects of maintaining the Olympic success achieved in Beijing is likely to continue to London 2012 and beyond," the authors wrote.
