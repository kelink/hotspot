(Reuters) - European shares rallied early on Monday, taking their cue from U.S. and Asian stock markets, the latter which gained strongly on data showing China's manufacturing sector continued to expand moderately in May.
At 0723 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300
index of top European shares was up 2.0 percent at 879.58 points, having hit 880.55 points -- its highest level since Jan. 9.
The benchmark index rose 0.7 percent last week. In May, it rose 4 percent, a third straight monthly gain and its best winning streak in two years.
Asian stocks and the Australian dollar shot to eight-month highs on Monday after China's official purchasing managers' index (PMI) recorded its third straight month above the mark of 50 that separates expansion from contraction, fuelling optimism that the worst of the global downturn may be over.
"Three consecutive months of readings above 50 really shows that Chinese stimulatory policy is gaining traction. It looks like an economic recovery is well underway in China, possibly leading to a sustained rally and re-rating of commodity prices and associated stocks," IG Markets said in a note.
