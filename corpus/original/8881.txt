Oct 29 (Reuters) - Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's MDC party has stopped cooperation in a unity government with arch-rival President Robert Mugabe over a dispute on the full implementation of their power-sharing deal.
Below are some of the issues on which Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and Mugabe's ZANU-PF party are feuding:
* The MDC would like Mugabe to swear in Roy Bennett, the party's treasurer-general, as deputy agriculture minister and the state to drop treason charges against him which the party says are being trumped up to keep him out of office.
- Mugabe says Bennett -- a top white politician being vilified in the local state media as the face of Zimbabwe's former white Rhodesian rulers -- will only be allowed to join the government if he is cleared by the courts.
* The MDC would like Attorney-General Johannes Tomana and Zimbabwe central bank governor Gideon Gono, both ZANU-PF allies accused of partisan behaviour, replaced by consensus candidates.
- Mugabe argues that he appointed both men constitutionally before the MDC joined the power-sharing government in February. Although the Sept. 15 power-sharing pact says Mugabe should consult Tsvangirai as prime minister in appointing top state officials, it doesn't require him to secure his agreement.
* Tsvangirai would like Mugabe to appoint several MDC officials as provincial governors in proportion to his party's strength in parliament. He says Mugabe agreed to do that at a regional summit which secured Zimbabwe's power-sharing deal. - On his part, Mugabe says provincial governors represent the state president in the provinces, and that the constitution empowers him to exercise his discretion on such appointments. He has vowed to resist being forced to share this authority.
* Tsvangirai wants Mugabe to allow him to chair cabinet meetings in his absence, arguing that under the power-sharing agreement, the prime minister is effectively head of government.
- When he is travelling, Mugabe has cancelled cabinet meetings and his ZANU-PF party maintains that under the constitution the cabinet is chaired by the president or an acting president. In his absence, Mugabe's vice-president acts in his place.
To underline this, Zimbabwe's state media now routinely refers to Mugabe as "Head of State, Head of Government and Commander-In-Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces".
Tsvangirai's supporters and officials also refer to the MDC leader as "The Right Honourable Prime Minister and Head of Government".
* The MDC accuses ZANU-PF officials of persecuting its members through selective prosecutions, and of late launching a campaign of violence and intimidation to weaken its structures.
- Mugabe's party says the MDC wants legal immunity for all its members, including for common criminal activity, and is using charges of rights abuses to tarnish its image abroad.
* The MDC is demanding an end to continuing invasions of white-owned commercial farms by ZANU-PF supporters, saying the government should be spearheading efforts to raise farm output.
- Mugabe's officials say the president is carefully considering proposals forwarded to him by a parliamentary committee. But privately they say ZANU-PF only has access to Zimbabwe's public media, against an MDC opposition backed the local private press and big foreign media houses.
* Mugabe argues that he has met his side of the power-sharing agreement while the MDC still has to campaign for the lifting of Western sanctions against his ZANU-PF, including travel restrictions and a freeze on general financial aid to the country.
- The MDC says it has no power over Western countries with sanctions on ZANU-PF, but that Mugabe's party can help its case by implementing radical reforms and ending rights abuses.
* ZANU-PF wants an end to a propaganda campaign by MDC supporters abroad, including the closure of what it calls foreign-funded pirate radio stations being run by Zimbabweans in Britain and the U.S.
- The MDC argues that it has no control over them, but that they were forced abroad by the lack of press freedom at home. (Reporting by Cris Chinaka; Editing by Giles Elgood)
