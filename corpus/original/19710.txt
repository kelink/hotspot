* Silvery-grey zirconium is the 20th most abundant element in the earth's crust.
* There are good reserves of zircon sand in many countries including South Africa, Brazil, Indonesia, Russia, Australia, Ukraine, Peru, India, China and the United States.
* Fractions of the sand are turned into sponge, then zirconium metal or zircaloy and hafnium -- used in control rods at some nuclear reactors to slow down or speed up the fission process. The ratio of zirconium to hafnium produced is 50:1.
* Control rods can also be made from a mixture of indium, cadmium and silver.
* Zirconium is used because fuel rods have to last for six years or more in a high temperature, high pressure, high radiation environment without failure. No other metal can match zirconium's low neutron absorption qualities.
* However, there are some research programmes looking at the use of ceramics as an alternative.
DEMAND/SUPPLY/CAPACITY * U.S-based Ux Consulting in a recent report estimates current zirconium metal production capacity at about 8,600 tonnes a year, demand at around 5,000 tonnes. Also estimates demand in five years could be 6,500 tonnes.
* Trading firm Lipmann Walton estimates global zirconium supplies at around 6,750 tonnes a year.
* French nuclear power specialist CEPFi.PA, Cezus-Areva estimates worldwide zirconium metal market at about 5,000 tonnes, with 40 percent of that produced by itself.
* Lipmann estimates prices of nuclear grade zirconium sponge at between $60 and $80 a kg, up from $40 a kg five years ago.

) and Western Zirconium, part of Westinghouse -- owned by Japan's Toshiba (
* Earlier this week Westinghouse said it had agreed form a joint venture to build and operate a plant to produce nuclear grade zirconium sponge with China's State Nuclear Baoti Zirconium Industry Company. (For details click
* Currently there are around 436 nuclear power reactors operating in 30 countries plus Taiwan. In 2007 they provided about 15 percent of the world's electricity.
* Nuclear power capacity worldwide is increasing steadily, with more than 40 reactors under construction in 12 countries.
* Most reactors on order or planned are in the Asian region, though plans are firming for new units in Europe, the United States and Russia.
* As of April, 110 nuclear reactors are planned and another 272 have been proposed.
* Zirconium's use elsewhere accounts for about 16 percent of demand, according to Lipmann Walton.
* An alloy made of copper, chrome, nickel and zirconium is used to conduct electricity, used by the electronics industry.
