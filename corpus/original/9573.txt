(Reuters) - Recapital Advisors, an Indonesian investment firm, is nearing an agreement to buy Indonesian coal miner PT Berau Coal for at least $1.3 billion, according to sources familiar with the deal.
Recapital has received a verbal agreement that they are the winning bidder, two sources told Reuters, adding the deal could be finalised by the end of the year.
Under the deal, Recapital will buy a 51 percent stake from Armadian Tritunggal -- an investment firm controlled by Indonesian businessman Rizal Risjad -- which would trigger the sale of remaining shares in Berau, sources said.
"Yes we are bidding for Berau," Rosan P. Roeslani, president director of Recapital, told Reuters, without confirming that his firm was the winning bidder.
The sources said Recapital is backed by Indonesia's politically-connected Bakrie group, which also owns a big stake in coal miner Bumi Resources (
), though Roeslani said Recapital was not teaming up with the Bakrie group for the deal.
) is advising Recapital, one of the sources said.
The deal has seen many twists and turns since it was launched earlier this year. China's Huaneng Power (
) and Indonesia's PT Indika Energy (
) had also submitted bids, sources told Reuters in July.
Thailand's top coal miner Banpu BANP.BK may also have bid for the stake while mining giant Xstrata XTA.L and Peabody Energy (
) previously expressed interest [ID:nHKG293444]. (Reporting by Saeed Azhar and Harry Suhartono; Editing by Neil Chatterjee)
