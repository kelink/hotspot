Sunday's landslide victory for Yukio Hatoyama's Democrats ends a half-century of almost unbroken rule by the Liberal Democratic Party and breaks a deadlock in parliament.
Analysts said the market was struggling to interpret the results of the election, with the Nikkei rising by more than 2 percent at one point, falling by over 1 percent later, and turning briefly positive several times after that.

The Nikkei lost 0.4 percent or 41.61 points to 10,492.53 after bouncing briefly to an 11-month high of 10,767.00, led by buying of Nikkei futures that set off short-covering. But it fell back as the yen advanced to a seven-week peak against the dollar and exporters lost ground.
tumbled 5.6 percent, breaking beneath the key 125-day moving average used by Chinese investors to delineate a bull versus a bear market, amid disappointing corporate earnings and upcoming new share issues.
Market players said there was little sign of foreign investors -- long a key driver of the Nikkei -- in the market, with some investors selling on the fact the election was over.

"We had fairly good industrial production data this morning and fundamentally, the overall economic situation is not that bad," said Hideyuki Ishiguro, a supervisor at the investment information section of Okasan Securities.
"Over the longer term, the fact that the uncertainty of the election and the policy deadlock are both gone will be good for the market. Foreign investors are likely to emerge from tomorrow, after they've had time to study the situation."
