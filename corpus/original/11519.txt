(Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries climbed in Asia on Friday with traders citing reports that China plans to tighten capital requirements for banks, pushing the benchmark 10-year yield to its lowest in more than a month.
Treasury note futures hit a more than one-month high as regional stock markets extended falls and U.S. stock futures SPc1 fell 0.6 percent, pointing to a possible drop at the opening in New York later in the day.
Investors nervously awaited the resumption of trade in Shanghai shares after Bloomberg reported that China plans to tighten capital requirements for banks, quoting three people familiar with the matter.
Sources said earlier in the month that China's banking regulator, concerned that record lending could lead to a spike in bad loans, might tighten banks' capital rules by excluding subordinated bonds they sell to other banks from their capital base. [ID:nSP529534]
