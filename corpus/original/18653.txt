(Reuters) - Sportswear maker Adidas ADSG.DE plans to lower its debt debt level and sees the potential to improve its operating margin in the medium term as it battles the impact the economic crisis, which is set to end an eight-year streak of rising annual earnings.
"The year 2009 is very challenging," Chief Executive Herbert Hainer told shareholders in a speech at the group's annual shareholders' meeting on Thursday.
The world's second-largest sporting goods maker after Nike (
) expects 2009 margins, net income and earnings per share (EPS) to decline due to higher operating costs and sees group sales down by up to mid-single-digit rates.
On Tuesday, however, Adidas had shocked investors with a 97 percent drop in first-quarter net income as the global economic downturn caught up with the group, pushing up input prices, fuelling currency devaluations and hitting consumer spending.
To save more than 100 million euros ($133 million) annually, Adidas now plans to cut 1,000 of its almost 39,000 staff this year, close regional offices and potentially some of its stores.
To get into shape for future opportunities, Adidas aims to lower its gearing ratio to below 50 percent in the medium term. Its financial leverage stood at 81.8 percent at the end of March, up from 64.6 percent at the end of 2008.
"With a strong balance sheet and low debt we will always be able to utilise opportunities in the market in the interest of our shareholders," said Hainer, whose contract was extended beyond 2010. Adidas did not say until when the extension runs.
Hainer, who took over as CEO in March 2001, said the Herzogenaurach-based company has the potential to widen its operating margin to more than 11 percent in the medium term.
Adidas shares were up 2 percent at 25.55 euros by 1130 GMT, outperforming a 1.5 percent gain in Germany's blue-chip DAX index
"After the disastrous Q1 figures and the launch of a restructuring programme, investor focus has already shifted to 2010," said Commerzbank analyst Christoph Dolleschal in a note to clients.
"With 2009 likely to be a 'lost year' the question is, to what levels can gross and operating margins recover in 2010."
Adidas shares trade at 12.6 times 12-month forward earnings, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, which weights analysts' forecasts according to their track record.
That is a discount to Nike, which trades at a multiple of about 15, as investors remain wary of weak performance at Adidas' U.S. brand Reebok. Reebok posted an operating loss of 96 million euros in the first quarter.
