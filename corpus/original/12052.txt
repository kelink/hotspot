* Exports of 21,000 tonnes of concentrate to start in Q3
SYDNEY, Aug 13 (Reuters - Magellan Metals will start exporting 21,000 tonnes of stockpiled lead concentrate starting in the third quarter of this year after receiving final environmental clearance from Fremantle port, the company's Canadian parent Ivernia Inc (
Ivernia also said it would reopen its Australian mine early in 2010, more than two years after it was idled when the port of Esperance banned lead shipments over environmental health concerns.
In May, the last of an 8,000-tonne stockpile of lead concentrate at the Esperance port was shipped by Ivernia to a buyer in China.
The company was banned from making any further shipments via Esperance, forcing it to seek an alternative port on Australia's western coast.
Located about 900 kilometres (560 miles) northeast of Perth, the Magellan mine was set to supply 100,000 tonnes of lead a year, or about 3 percent of the world's mined lead, before it closed. Chinese smelting firms were its major customers.
The benchmark three-month London Metal Exchange lead contract MPB3, which sank below $900 a tonne in late 2008, raising doubts over the mine's economic viability, has since recovered to over $1,900 a tonne. (Reporting by James Regan; Editing by Michael Urquhart)
