(Reuters) - The United States on Monday set large punitive duties on imports of steel wheels from China that it said were unfairly priced and subsidized, in the latest sign of trade tension between the world's two biggest economies.
The decision was a victory for Accuride Corporation and Hayes Lemmerz International Inc, which filed a pair of petitions last year asking for import relief.
The department will issue a preliminary duty decision on Tuesday in a high-profile case against solar panels from China, which U.S. manufacturers complain are unfairly priced and subsidized.

¡°¡­Chinese producers were selling the steel wheels at prices 44.96 percent to 193.54 percent below fair value.¡± Clearly I do not understand fair value in this context ¨C how can you be greater than 100 percent below fair value? I can¡¯t believe they are implying a $100 wheel was ¡°sold¡± by giving the buyer $93.54. Doug Palmer ¡ª can you explain this, as the reporter? Or anyone feel free to educate me on this. Thanks!
