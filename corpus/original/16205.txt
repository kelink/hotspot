(Reuters) - Indian miner Sesa Goa (
) aims to raise iron ore output by more than half to 22.75 million tonnes in 2009/10, helped in part by the acquisition of assets from a small rival, its managing director said on Friday, sending its shares to their highest in a year.
"Last year, we had a production of 15 million tonnes. This year, we are likely to have volume growth of 25 percent. Plus, you could add 4 million tonnes (from the acquisition)," P.K. Mukherjee told Reuters over the telephone.
Sesa, a subsidiary of London listed metal and mining group Vedanta Resources (
), said late on Thursday it acquired the mining assets of Dempo Group in the western state of Goa for 17.5 billion rupees ($368 million) to boost its output of iron ore. [ID:nBOM345267].
"We are continuously looking for it. Targets are always there," he said, when asked if there would be more acquisitions this year.
Shares in Sesa, which has a market value of $3.2 billion, jumped as much as 7 percent to 205.50 rupees, their highest since June 2, 2008.
The stock has risen about 140 percent this year, outpacing the main index
The company, India's biggest private sector iron ore miner and a leading exporter, is also looking to expand existing facilities in mineral rich Goa, Mukherjee said.
"From here, everything is meant for the export market," he said, referring to the mostly low grade ores available in Goa that are a favourite of Chinese steel mills who generally blend them with the high grade ores from Australia and Brazil.
India is the world's third biggest supplier of iron ore, exporting half of its 200 million tonne production every year, mostly to China. [ID:nBOM494335] ($1=47.5 rupees) (Reporting by Ruchira Singh; Editing by Ranjit Gangadharan)
