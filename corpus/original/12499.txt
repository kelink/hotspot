(Reuters) - China, the largest single investor in Zambia, is demanding an inquiry into the deaths of three of its nationals killed in robberies since the start of the year, officials said on Thursday.
In the latest incident, a Chinese construction worker was murdered in the capital Lusaka by a robber who also wounded his mother before stealing $5,000 and other personal items, the Times of Zambia newspaper reported.
"We are disturbed with the killings and it is for this reason that we have written to the Zambian government ... and the (police) over the matter," Fan Manjiang, the chief of political section at the Chinese embassy, told state media.
"We are investigating all the cases and we will ensure that the killers are arrested and punished. Unfortunately you cannot say that such crimes are restricted to the Chinese," Mangani told Reuters.
Official data shows that China has invested in excess of $1.2 billion mainly in Zambia's mining industry, the economic lifeblood of the southern African country.
The government says an additional $4.2 billion in Chinese investments is expected to be poured into copper mining, manufacturing and agriculture, as the Asian country positions itself as a major economic partner for Zambia.
But Zambian trade unions have accused Chinese firms operating in the country of paying low wages and maintaining poor safety standards, although the government says the Chinese have taken measures to improve both wages and safety standards.
In 2005, riots by miners at the Chinese-owned Chambishi mine in the restive Copperbelt province left five Zambians wounded after they were shot by Chinese managers, following pay protests. (Editing by Shapi Shacinda and Richard Balmforth)
