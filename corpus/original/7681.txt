(Reuters) - Hong Kong's central bank intervened in foreign exchange markets three times on Friday, selling HK$6.2 billion (US$800 million) for U.S. dollars late in the afternoon to stem an appreciating Hong Kong dollar and keep it within its fixed trading band.
Earlier in the day, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) injected HK$10.463 billion into the market in two interventions. The latest move brought total injections for the day to HK$16.663 billion as of 1017 GMT.

While Hong Kong was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, the currency of the former British colony remained pegged to the U.S. dollar, not the yuan, which is not fully convertible. But rumours about the yuan can at times influence sentiment.
According to data on a Reuters page, the latest intervention will lift the aggregate balance -- the sum of balances on clearing accounts maintained by banks with the HKMA -- to a record HK$306.378 billion by Nov. 17.
Under the linked exchange rate mechanism, the HKMA is usually obliged to intervene in the market to keep the trading band intact if the currency hits 7.75 or 7.85.
