(Reuters) - Copper surged to a one-month high on Wednesday as the dollar weakened and upbeat U.S. corporate and economic numbers spurred investor confidence that the global economy had passed the worst of its downturn.
Copper for September delivery HGU9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division rallied 9.30 cents, or 4 percent, to settle at $2.3920 a lb, after dealing in a range from $2.2955 to $2.4055, its highest level since June 12.
On the London Metal Exchange (LME), copper for three-months delivery MCU3 closed up $218 at $5,263 a tonne.
Copper's gains tracked a broader rally in global equity markets after solid quarterly results from Goldman Sachs (
Rob Kurzatkowski futures analyst with OptionsXpress in Chicago, said the better-than-expected U.S. manufacturing and industrial production figures helped restore some market confidence.
"I think the markets are trying to cling to any type of positive news at this point," he said. "We have been getting pummeled with some bad data as of late and people were starting to think that those green shoots were getting choked down by weeds ... the data has given something for traders to latch on to for a change."
The strong corporate earnings and U.S. data weighed heavily on the dollar, making dollar-priced metals cheaper for non-U.S investors. [USD/]
"A strong recovery is already priced into commodities. It's premature ... we will see stabilization of demand, but I doubt we will see a strong recovery," he said.
The economic recovery may yet be protracted, and the trend of falling copper stocks is set to stall as markets enter a traditionally quiet trading season.
Copper stocks in LME warehouses rose 4,200 tonnes to 261,100 tonnes, but are still way below 500,000 tonnes in late February.
Copper has risen around 65 percent this year, mostly due to Chinese buying, as the world's biggest copper consumer imported 1.8 million tonnes of refined copper in the first half.
"Overall ... we still expect refined imports to ease in the coming months although the magnitude of the fall is likely to be lower than previous market expectations," said Barclays Capital.
Also, data showed a dominant position controlling between 50 percent and 80 percent of LME copper stocks as of Monday. Traders said this was behind copper moving into backwardation -- a premium of $20.00 for LME cash copper over the three-month contract. This compares to a contango of $14.50 on July 8.
Elsewhere, aluminum MAL3 was at $1,655 from $1,605. Stocks of the metal used in transport and packaging rose 63,125 tonnes to a record above 4.5 million tonnes.
Aluminum stocks have risen almost consistently this year, and while fundamentals remain poor, confidence in Chinese purchases and recovery hopes have lifted demand recently.
Elsewhere, zinc MZN3 was at $1,542 from $1,495, battery material lead MPB3 was at $1,635 from $1,595, while tin MSN2 was last quoted at $13,300/13,325 from $12,900. Steel-making ingredient nickel MNI3 was at $15,940 from $15,575.
Traders remain concerned about the scale of long positions in the tin market, compared with the amount of available metal in LME warehouses [ID:nL6246168]
