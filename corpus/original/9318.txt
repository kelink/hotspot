Following are details of glaciers and the wider impacts of climate change on hydropower, the most widely used form of renewable energy:
Himalayan glaciers may shrink to 100,000 square km (40,000 sq miles) by the 2030s from 500,000 sq km if current warming rates continue. That would increase river flows in some river systems for two to three decades, followed by decreasing flows.
Water supplies will be hit in areas fed by melt water from the Hindu Kush and Himalayas, on which hundreds of millions of people in China, Pakistan and India depend.
For the whole of Europe -- where 20 percent of electricity comes from hydropower -- generating potential of hydropower plants is projected to decrease by six percent by the 2070s, mainly because of changes in precipitation.
That translates into a 20-50 percent decline around the Mediterranean, a 15-30 percent increase in northern and eastern Europe and little change for western and central Europe.
Over the next 15 years, inter-tropical glaciers are very likely to disappear in the Andes, reducing water availability and hydropower generation in Bolivia, Peru, Colombia and Ecuador. The issue is already "critical" in the four nations.
By the 2020s, about 41 percent of water supplies to southern California are likely to be vulnerable to warming from loss of Sierra Nevada and Colorado River basin snowpack.
Hydropower generation is likely to be hit by climate change, according to a study of hydro-electric power generation in the Zambezi Basin. The snows on the peak of Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak, have shrunk by 80 percent in the past century.
* AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND
Annual streamflow in Australia's Murray Darling basin is likely to fall by 10-25 percent by 2050 and 16-48 percent by 2100. In New Zealand, annual flow from larger rivers in the Southern Alps is likely to increase. Proportionately more runoff is very likely in winter and less in summer -- helping hydro-electric generation during the winter peak demand period.
