(Reuters) - Brazilian stocks rose on Wednesday but ended well off the day's highs as data from major economies gave mixed signals on a possible global recovery while heavyweight Petrobras slumped along with oil prices.
closed up 0.15 percent at 51,543.78 as investors retrenched from a morning rush that had added as much as 1.6 percent.
Data from major economies shed little light on the sustainability of a possible economic recovery, with investors balancing weakness in the U.S. labor market with incipient signs of improvement in the global manufacturing sector.
Despite deeper-than-expected payroll cuts by U.S. private employers, manufacturing data from the United States, euro zone and China provided investors with some relief, boosting global stock markets. U.S. manufacturing contracted more slowly in June and euro zone manufacturing contracted less than expected that same month. Manufacturing in China, an important engine of the global economy, notched another month of growth.
Brazil's currency, the real BRBY, climbed 1.68 percent to 1.93 reais to the dollar as hopes for a global recovery increased appetite for risk.

Because Petrobras is the most heavily weighted stock in the index, its fall helped erode morning gains, noted a trader who asked to remain anonymous. Petrobras on Wednesday also launched $1.250 billion worth of a reopened global bond due in 2019, paying a yield of 6.875 percent. The company sold $1.5 billion of the same bonds in February.

Changes in the yields on Brazilian interest rate futures contracts <0#DIJ:> were mixed, with the central bank widely expected to reduce monetary policy further in coming months but in smaller doses. The yield on the contract due in January 2011 DIJF1, the day's most heavily traded, dipped 0.5 percentage points to 9.97 percent. (Editing by Leslie Adler)
