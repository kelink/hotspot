Zhao is currently chairman of Citi's China investment banking, a role she will maintain. Simon, head of Financial Entrepreneurs Group in Japan, will relocate to Hong Kong to take up the new position before the year-end.
Zhao joined Citi in 2006 from Morgan Stanley to lead the China Investment Banking team, getting involved in deals such as the merger of China Netcom and Unicom and the IPOs of China Coal and Citic Bank.
Yoo joined Citi's FIG team in New York in 1997 and was co-head of FIG Japan from 2005 to 2007, before leading Japan's financial entrepreneurs sector team, the group within Citi that is in charge of private equity advisory and banking. (Reporting by Michael Flaherty; Editing by Anshuman Daga)
