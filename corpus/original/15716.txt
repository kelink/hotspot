EU to offer China help in burying CO2 emissions

(Reuters) - Europe will next week start moves to help China and India develop technology to trap and bury carbon dioxide underground in the fight against global warming, according to a draft European Commission document.
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), a process of burying harmful gases, is seen by some as a potential silver bullet to curb emissions from coal-fired power plants, which are multiplying rapidly worldwide and threaten to heat the atmosphere to dangerous levels.
"The Commission intends to raise money and develop a financing vehicle to support the EU-China Near Zero Emissions Coal (NZEC) project and subsequent similar CCS demonstration activities in emerging economies and fossil-fuel dependent developing countries," the document said.
The executive Commission's EU-China Near Zero Emissions Coal (NZEC) proposal will initially tap into about 60 million euros of existing EU development funding, but will also seek further support from industry and taxpayers.
"It is likely that the CCS component of the Chinese NZEC demonstration project alone will cost in total around 300 million euros," said the report.
