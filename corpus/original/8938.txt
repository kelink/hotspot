METALS-Copper hits 1-week low as data spurs demand worry
2009-10-28 15:17:00.0
(Reuters) - Copper weakened into the close on Wednesday, hitting its lowest level in one week, as concerns over a growing supply base and poor demand conditions outside of China were exacerbated by weak housing data in the United States.
Copper for December delivery HGZ9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division sank 6.85 cents, or 2.3 percent, to close at $2.9305 a lb, after dealing in a session range between $3.0340 and $2.9220, its lowest level since Oct. 21.
On the London Metal Exchange (LME), copper for three-months delivery MCU3 ended down $155 at $6,430 a tonne, near its session trough at $6,420, another one-week low.

Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist with Lind-Waldock in Chicago, said the surprisingly weak home sales figures reminded the market of still poor demand conditions outside of China, and prices of the metal used in construction and electrical wiring could continue to correct further.
"I think reality has set in that the only driving factor that has kept up copper, beside the hedge, has been the Chinese with their hoarding of a physical commodity," he said.
Inventories of copper at LME warehouses rose 1,075 tonnes to 371,725 tonnes, their highest level since May.
"There is an ongoing oversupply of copper into the international market ... LME inventories are increasing and so is the copper price -- it doesn't work," said Charles Kernot, an analyst at Evolution Securities.
An extended bounce in the U.S. dollar added further downside pressure on the metal, as its tends to make dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.
But the outlook for China, which surprised markets with its fifth heaviest copper imports on record for last month, will continue to drive demand as consumption by the construction sector picks up, to replace slowing stockpiling.
"China continues to dominate the copper market, especially after the massive government stimulus package injected into its economy for infrastructure spending," said Andrey Kryuchenkov, an analyst at VTB Capital.
