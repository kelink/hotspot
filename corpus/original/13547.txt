(Reuters) - P.F. Chang's China Bistro Inc PFCB.O posted a better-than-expected jump in quarterly profit on Wednesday and raised its profit forecast as cost improvements offset the impact of consumers cutting back on dining at its restaurants.
Sit-down restaurants like P.F. Chang's have suffered from a lingering recession, with many chains slashing costs and using discounts to attract diners.
Net income rose to $11.6 million, or 49 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 28, from $9.4 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier.
Earnings from continuing operations increased by 10 cents per share to 51 cents, topping analysts' average expectation of 41 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.
P.F. Chang's now expects to earn $1.60 to $1.65 per share from continuing operations this year, up from a prior forecast of $1.45 to $1.50. The company cited continued improvements in restaurant operating margin. (Reporting by Jessica Wohl in Chicago and Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
