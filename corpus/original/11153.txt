(Reuters) - Here is some background on the tin industry in Indonesia, the world's top exporter and second-largest producer after China. Indonesia produces nearly 30 percent of the world's refined tin.
- Bangka Island, off Sumatra's east coast, is the world's largest tin-producing area. Neighbouring islands Belitung and Singkep are also rich in the metal.
- The government controls tin mining and smelting on Bangka. - In 2002, Jakarta banned exports of tin ore to stop illegal mining from damaging Bangka's environment. The move led to the proliferation of small smelters.
- In October 2006, Indonesia shut down three tin smelters operating without permits on Bangka island, and announced new rules for tin miners.
Since the introduction of tin export rules, the government has approved export permits for 27 smelters including PT Timah Tbk (
), the world's largest integrated tin miner, and PT Koba Tin, a unit of Malaysia Smelting Corp Bhd (

Indonesia has mineable tin reserve of 338,115 tonnes measured in terms of refined tin and deposits of 650,135 tonnes.
- The government had planned to limit annual tin production to support prices and reduce environmental damage, but so far has not introduced any formal regulations.
The government has said it may not need to limit output as output is naturally declining due to weak demand. However, it has not completely shelved the plan.
- From Indonesia the metal is shipped to Malaysia via Singapore, where it is given London Metal Exchange (LME) branding, and then sold on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market or directly to consumers in Europe. It is also exported to Thailand.
- Tin is used in electronics, plating and lead-free solders. Source: Reuters, Energy and Mineral Ministry data. (Reporting by Fitri Wulandari; Editing by Michael Urquhart)
