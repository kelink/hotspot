Merkel issued a rare critique of central banks in early June, saying she viewed quantitative easing steps by the Federal Reserve with a "great deal of scepticism."
She is keen to shift the focus back to "exit strategies", or steps to consolidate budgets and remove liquidity from the system once the recovery takes hold.
Berlin wants a U.N. summit in Copenhagen in December to agree an ambitious new climate treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol and wants Obama to back plans by other developed countries for a 25-40 percent reduction in CO2 levels by 2020 compared to 1990. Germany also supports setting an upper limit for global warming of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), a level the Obama administration has not embraced.
Obama wants the United States to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, but believes commitments by India, China and other big developing countries are also crucial to a new global agreement on climate change.
Although Merkel was a vocal critic of the detention camp for terrorism suspects in Guantanamo Bay and publicly pressed the U.S. government to close it, her government has resisted Washington's requests to accept inmates from the prison that Obama says he will close by early 2010.
With an eye on a federal election in September, Merkel's government has set strict criteria for the acceptance of inmates, including that they have a link to Germany.
Germany has resisted U.S. pressure to send more troops to Afghanistan and shift them from the north to areas in the south and east where there is more intense fighting against the Taliban. The looming Afghan election has clouded this issue, with Merkel reluctant to commit more troops to a conflict that is deeply unpopular in Germany.
