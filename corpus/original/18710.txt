(Reuters) - Templeton Asset Management's veteran fund manager Mark Mobius said on Thursday that confidence has returned to financial markets, and he was bullish on commodities and firms that catered to emerging market consumers.
Mobius, who helps manage around $20 billion as lead portfolio manager for Templeton's Emerging Markets Group, said the spread between emerging market bond yields and U.S. Treasuries has stabilized which is a sign market confidence has returned.
"We believe we are now at a turning point," he said at an investor conference in Singapore.
The fall in the VIX .VIX, the Chicago Board's stock volatility index or so-called fear gauge, was another sign that markets had become more confident.
Mobius said China and India's rapid growth will spur demand for consumer goods, while commodity prices have returned to their growth path after a correction.
"I'm a believer that the trend is your friend. There is always going to be a reversal to the mean (for commodity prices) and the mean is an upward sloping line," he said.
He cited copper as one of the commodities he liked, pointing to strong Chinese demand, as well as palladium, which he said was cheaper than platinum but could be of use for many similar purposes.
