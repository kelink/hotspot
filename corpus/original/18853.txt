UPDATE 4-Alstom sees boost for rail engineering
2009-05-05 06:48:00.0
(Reuters) - Alstom (
), the manufacturer of France's 320 kilometre-an-hour TGVs, expects the rail sector to benefit as governments from the United States to China invest in high-speed railways as part of economic stimulus plans.
The prediction came as the French engineering company, which also produces power generation equipment, posted a drop in fourth-quarter order intake but stuck to its operating margin goal of around 9 percent fro the year to March 2010.
"In all the government stimulus plans, there is an infrastructure element, and there is a rail infrastructure element," Alstom Chief Executive Patrick Kron told a news conference on Tuesday.
Alstom's competitors include Germany's Siemens (
), which also makes power plants and subway trains and posted forecast-beating second quarter results last week, and Canadian transport giant Bombardier Inc (
Alstom posted sales of 18.74 billion euros ($24.81 billion) in the year ended March 31, just missing a forecast of 18.99 billion in a Reuters poll of 21 analysts but 11 percent higher than last year.
Operating profit rose 19 percent to 1.54 billion euros, just beating the average estimate of 1.53 billion. The group achieved an operating margin of 8.2 percent in the year.
Shares in Alstom fell, however, as it declined to give an outlook for its operating margin beyond the current financial year. Natixis analysts told clients they saw a risk of eroding margins in power activities from 2010-11 onwards.
The shares, which have risen 70 percent since October, were down 2.5 percent at 48.89 euros by 0954 GMT, having initially risen to a near seven-month high of 51.45 euros.
"The brutal downturn in the world's economy has created uncertainties in our markets," Kron said in a statement. The current financial year was unlikely to bring a "crop of the century" in terms of new orders, he added.
"Annual earnings are of good quality, although they were marked, as expected, by a fall in orders in the fourth quarter," one Paris-based trader said.
The group's order book stood at 45.67 billion euros at the end of March 2009, with order intake for the full year up 5 percent at 24.58 billion.
In contrast to rail transport, Alstom said it saw demand for new electricity generation equipment declining as some projects were postponed.
Kron reiterated interest in buying the transmission and distribution unit of state nuclear power group Areva CEPFi.PA but ruled out taking a minority stake in Areva's nuclear reactor unit after Siemens (
) decided to sell its 34 percent stake. ($1=.7554 Euro) (Additional reporting by Benjamin Mallet; Editing by Tim Hepher and David Holmes)
