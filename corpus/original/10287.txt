(Reuters) - Hunan Nonferrous Metals Corp Ltd (
) has halted operations at a 10,000-tonne-per-year antimony mine shaft while it investigates why two mine cages fell on Thursday, killing 26 people and injuring five.
Shares of Hunan Nonferrous fell 2.2 percent in morning trade on Friday, compared with a 0.01 percent drop in the blue chip Hang Seng Index
The accident occurred at the No. 2 shaft of the south mine of Hsikwangshan Twinkling Star in Hunan province in China, the world's main supplier of antimony. China has reduced exports this year following increased domestic consumption.
"Production of that mine has halted," said a senior executive at Hsikwangshan Twinkling Star Antimony Co Ltd, China's top miner and producer of antimony and a subsidiary of HNC.
"Our metal production may fall this year from the normal 28,000-30,000 tonne level," the executive said.
The firm also operates another antimony mine in Hunan, with annual production of 8,000-10,000 tonnes of the metal per year, and that mine was operating normally, the executive said.
