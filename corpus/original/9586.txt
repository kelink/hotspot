* Companhia Siderurgica de Ubu (CSU) - Originally conceived as a joint venture with China's Baosteel, Vale was later left as the only investor after Baosteel pulled out of the 5 million tonne-per-annum integrated steel slab plant.
* California Steel Industries (CSI) - Vale holds a 50 percent stake in a flat-rolled steel producer California Steel Industries (CSI) based in Fontana, California. Japan's JFE Steel holds the remaining stake.
