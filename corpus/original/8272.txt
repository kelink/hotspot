(Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said on Friday he wants to discuss the world economy with U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner next week.
Geithner will visit Japan on Nov. 10-11 to meet government officials before attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) finance ministers' meeting in Singapore on Nov. 12.
Fujii, speaking at a brief news conference after a cabinet meeting, said he would like to discuss with Geithner how to steer the world economy.
"We are basically in agreement on world economic strategy. I'd like to have a deeper discussion on that," Fujii said.
Geithner's visit to Tokyo marks his first trip to Japan since taking office in January. He will meet with senior government officials there "to discuss policies to bring about strong, sustainable and balanced growth", the U.S Treasury said.
The same topics will come up at the APEC meeting in Singapore, along with trade finance, public-private models for financing large infrastructure projects and development of capital markets.
Geithner will first attend attend a G20 finance ministers' meeting this weekend in Scotland. Japan will send Senior Vice Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda to the G20 meeting.
Achieving a time line for reforms to better balance the economy will be a key topic of discussions at that gathering, along with an emphasis on continued government support to foster economic growth.
Both the APEC and G20 meetings also will be attended by finance ministers from Japan, China, South Korea, Australia and Indonesia, among others. (Reporting by Hideyuki Sano)
