Petrobras bets on China for bankroll

(Reuters) - Brazil's state-run oil company Petrobras (
) hopes to raise a loan from the China Development Bank, its chief executive said on Tuesday, to guarantee financing in 2010-2011 for an aggressive investment plan.
Brazil signed an agreement on February 19 to supply China with 100,000 to 160,000 barrels of oil a day in what Petrobras expects to lead to $10 billion in financing to develop its huge subsalt oil fields.
Petrobras's Chief Executive Jose Sergio Gabrielli who spoke at the Reuters Latin American Investment Summit in Rio de Janeiro hinted that if the company secured the full financing from China, it could implement investment plans through 2020.
"The negotiations with China completes (financing) for 2010 and 2020," he said stopping himself. "... 2010 and 2011 ... We are in negotiations. I can't jump the guns with the details."
Petrobras announced earlier in 2009 that it would boost its five-year investment plan by 55 percent to a whopping $174 billion, when most oil majors were trimming capital spending to brace for falling demand amid the financial crisis.
"OPEC has cut 4 to 4.5 million (barrels per day), oil demand is showing a slight recovery outside the U.S. Then you've got the seasonal uptick from U.S. summer driving season. We don't see any big fall or rise in prices, (which should) float near current levels for the rest of the year," he said.
But he said the outlook for prices was bullish further into the future. Petrobras sees oil at $60-$65 a barrel on average in the long term, based on a group of analysts.
Gabrielli said, however, its investment plans to develop the massive, recently discovered subsalt oil fields were based on projections of oil at least $37 a barrel in 2009 and $40 a barrel in 2010-2011.
The executive said he did not expect large volumes of natural gas from the development of Brazil's subsalt reserves, from which it began pumping its first oil in recent weeks. Much of the gas would have to be re-injected to lift the oil, he said.
He insisted subsalt production was profitable at current oil prices, despite the technical challenge of drilling 7,000 meters below the ocean surface through 2,000 meters of salt with extreme pressures and temperatures, 300 km from the coast.
Petrobras began pumping sweet, medium grade crude from its 5 billion to 8 billion barrel Tupi subsalt field on May 1, when it began its long-term production tests of the field. Gabrielli said profit margins would only be known after test determined the consistency of flow rates in the ultra-deep reservoirs.
