(Reuters) - China and Pakistan are expected to sign a number of agreements during Prime Minister Wen Jiabao's visit which began on Friday.
Total value of the deals will be between $10 billion and $14 billion, with another $4.8 billion in commercial deals to be signed on Saturday. Here are some details.
* China will provide about $200 million in grants for flood reconstruction, mainly for roads and bridges.
* China will provide a $30 million grant to develop Pakistan's agricultural sector.
* The Safe City Islamabad project, aimed at increasing security in the Pakistani capital, will get about $195 million for surveillance cameras, command and control centers and giant scanners for trucks at the entry points to the city.
* Two other deals are related to improving the Karakorum Highway and setting up working groups on major energy projects such as coal, hydroelectric dams, oil and gas exploration and alternative energy.
* The two governments also will sign a deal to set up the National Electronic Complex of Pakistan (NECOP), for research and development as well as information technology and civilian and defense electronics.
Estimated to cost around $300 million, the complex will be launched in cooperation with China's state-owned CETC International. The government of Pakistan is expected to provide $100 million for the project, alongside a Chinese grant of $50 million. The remaining amount would come in the form of soft loans from China.
