(Reuters) - President Ian Khama, a UK-trained army lieutenant-general and son of the country's first president, is expected to win another five years in office in elections on Friday.
Khama's Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) has been in power since independence in 1966. Botswana is the world's biggest producer of diamonds and more recently became known for Precious Ramotswe, the heroine of Alexander McCall Smith's fictional "Lady Detective" series, set in the country's capital of Gaborone.

-- Botswana's economy probably shrank 11.5 percent in the financial year to the end of June 2009 due to a collapse in sales of diamonds, its key export, the finance ministry said last month.
-- Acting Finance Minister Kenneth Matambo also forecast a further contraction of 12.8 percent in the 12 months ending in June 2010, before projecting growth of 7 percent for the southern African economy in the following year.
-- The latest forecast paints a much steeper slowdown -- and far later recovery -- than initially expected for the world's biggest producer of diamonds, whose sales plummeted in 2008 when economic downturn started to hit rich countries.
-- The International Monetary Fund has forecast a contraction of 10.3 percent for the 2009 calendar year. Botswana was forced to close its diamond mines for several months -- the first shutdown in the industry's 40-year history.
-- Matambo said sales of diamonds, which account for nearly 40 percent of the economy and the same proportion of government cash, had been increasing since April.
-- The crisis has forced Botswana, seen as one of Africa's best-run countries with a history of budget surpluses and the region's strongest currency, to plunge itself into debt to keep afloat.
-- In May, it had to turn to South Africa's Standard Bank and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for $825 million needed for a new power station, and in June received a $1.5 billion budget bailout from the African Development Bank. -- With annual sales well in excess of $3 billion, diamonds had been helping turn Botswana into a model of commodity-powered development.
RELIGION - Mainly Christian, although traditional beliefs are also widespread. There are also Muslim and Hindu minorities.
LANGUAGE - English is the official language, but Setswana spoken widely.
GEOGRAPHY - Area is 581,730 sq km (225,000 sq miles). Two-thirds shallow desert basin, Botswana borders South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and has a tiny border with Zambia to the north. It is slightly larger than France.
HEALTH - Botswana is one of the countries in the region worst affected by HIV/AIDS. Nearly one quarter of people between the ages of 15 and 49 are living with HIV, compared to nearly a fifth in South Africa.
