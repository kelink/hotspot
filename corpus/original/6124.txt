(Reuters) - Taiwan and China signed a free trade agreement on Tuesday that Taiwan's government hopes will open the way for other such deals with major world economies, but China will block any bilateral accord with an island it claims as its own.
Export-dependent Taiwan, recognized by just 23 countries around the world and considered a breakaway province by U.N. Security Council member China, fears it will be left behind as other countries pursue trade deals with China and among themselves.
Following are the current free trade agreements that Taiwan has signed. The deals collectively cover less than 1 percent of Taiwan's total foreign trade.
