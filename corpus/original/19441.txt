Poor countries could face swine flu drug shortages

(Reuters) - Developing countries could struggle to access the antiviral drugs they need to combat a fast-spreading outbreak of swine flu, which has killed 103 people in Mexico, health activists said on Monday.
"It is going to become a problem," said Sangeeta Shashikant of the Third World Network, which campaigns for better drug access for the poor.
) and Relenza, made by GlaxoSmithKline (
), have been shown to be effective against the swine flu strain that has infected people in Mexico, the United States, Canada and Spain.
But there are not likely to be enough doses to treat the whole world in a pandemic, and production is limited.
"Many countries have stockpiled antivirals, although how to deliver them within a maximum of 48 hours remains a huge challenge," the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said in a statement.
"Preparedness levels in middle income and lower income countries remain low. Therefore it is likely that this flu outbreak will also be a test for global solidarity," it said.
The international health community must work to ensure that drugs reach those who truly need them to avoid needless deaths, said Mike Palmedo, research coordinator at American University's programme on information justice and intellectual property.
"I suspect that in the event of an epidemic, many countries would find their supplies inadequate," he said, suggesting that increased generic production could help ease shortfalls.
"Whatever the amount of drugs currently available, more generic competition would drive prices down further, making access available to more countries."
India's Cipla (
) began to manufacture generic oseltamivir, or Tamiflu, in 2006, and Ranbaxy (
) and Hetero also make the drug in India. Shanghai Pharmaceuticals 600849.SS and HEC also make it in China, according to Palmedo.
Efforts to create a swine flu vaccine could also create strains for poorer states, especially if manufacturers who take virus samples offer them at a high price, Shashikant warned.
"You need production for developing countries and access to technology," she said.
Indonesia created diplomatic uproar at the height of the world's bird flu pandemic fears three years ago when it refused to share virus samples without a guarantee that poor states would later be able to afford the vaccines developed.
Despite its shorthand name, the disease is spread person-to-person and has never been seen in pigs. It has components of classic avian, human and swine flu viruses. (For more stories on swine flu, click on [nFLU]) (For WHO information on swine flu, go to:
