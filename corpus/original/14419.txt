), Britain's Prudential Plc (
None of these entities is now interested, the newspaper said, citing the people.
Last month, AIG set plans to partially spin off Alico into a new unit partially owned by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which would take a $9 billion preferred stake.

Shares of AIG closed Wednesday down 65 cents at $13.10 on the New York Stock Exchange. MetLife shares fell 44 cents to $26.90 on the Big Board. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel, editing by Matthew Lewis)
