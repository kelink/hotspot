(Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei average lost 3.4 percent on Tuesday as a surge of bad loans at Bank of America revived fears about the U.S. financial system and economy, while a stronger yen hit exporters such as Canon Inc (
). Banks fell, with tech shares also sliding in the wake of worse-than-expected results from IBM (
) skidded 4.4 percent to 3,700 yen, after the Yomiuri newspaper said the company would likely produce about 6.2 million vehicles globally in the year to March 2010, down more than 12 percent amid a worldwide sales slump but roughly in line with expectations. [ID:nT30926]
The 41 percent climb in Bank of America's (
) first-quarter non-performing assets raised concerns about the sustainability of recent better-than-expected results from banks and revived broad risk aversion, hitting equity markets and boosting the yen.
"The recent results had reassured people, but now they're wondering if banks are really all right, especially as the announcement of results of the 'stress tests' draws nearer," said Hideyuki Ishiguro, a supervisor at the investment advisory department of Okasan Securities.
"But even amid these worries there are some signs of improvement in the real economy, especially in China, and this will prevent sharp selling."
The Obama administration is set to announce the outcome of the stress tests, assessing the ability of the country's largest 19 banks to cope with potential strains, on May 4.

"The euro and the Australian dollar had really fallen as risk aversion rises, and while the yen isn't really strong, it too is benefiting from this," said Nagayuki Yamagishi, a strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. "But basically the idea is that both Wall Street and the Nikkei have risen over the past few sessions, and it was time for a break anyway."

"In many ways, the worst for this round of earnings results is behind us, with both the Bank of America and Citigroup results out, and this has reassured the market over the short term," said Mitsubishi UFJ's Yamagishi.
"But there's no question that over the longer term things could still be kind of tough."
Tech shares slipped broadly, both on the weaker yen and after IBM (
