(Reuters) - Three days of talks between the United States and Russia, the world's two biggest nuclear powers, could eventually lead to deep cuts in the number of atomic weapons.
* UNITED STATES: According to the counting rules in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), as of January 2009 the United States had an estimated 5,200 nuclear warheads and 2,700 operationally deployed warheads (2,200 strategic and 500 nonstrategic warheads).
-- According to the May 2002 Treaty of Moscow (the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, or SORT) between the United States and the Russian Federation, both are required to reduce their nuclear arsenals to 1,700-2,200 operationally deployed warheads by 2012.
* RUSSIA: Under the provisions of START I, the Russian nuclear arsenal has been reduced to approximately 4,138 strategic nuclear warheads, as of July 2008.
* FRANCE: France has been a nuclear weapon state party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) since 1992. In 2008, President Nicolas Sarkozy announced the country would leave its submarine missile arsenal in place while cutting its stock of air-launched weapons by a third.
-- As of September 2008, France had already pared down its arsenal to approximately 300 nuclear warheads.
* CHINA: China's nuclear weapons program began in 1955 and culminated in a successful nuclear test in 1964. Since then, China has conducted 45 nuclear tests, including tests of thermonuclear weapons and a neutron bomb.
-- China is estimated to have about 400 strategic and tactical nuclear weapons, and stocks of fissile material sufficient to produce a much larger arsenal. It acceded to the NPT in 1992 as a nuclear weapon state.
-- Six-Party Talks between North Korea, South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and the United States began in 2003 to quell North Korea's nuclear ambitions but broke down in 2005.
-- Talks were resumed in 2007 and in June 2008 North Korea presented a list of its nuclear arms programs. However, North Korea said last month it would restart its nuclear plant that makes arms-grade plutonium.
* PAKISTAN: Pakistan is believed to have stockpiled approximately 580-800 kg of highly enriched uranium, sufficient amounts to build 30-50 fission bombs. According to the United States, China helped Pakistan by providing nuclear-related materials, scientific expertise and technical assistance. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists estimated in 2007 the Pakistani arsenal comprised about 60 warheads.
-- Based on estimates of the plutonium production capacity of the Dimona reactor, Israel has approximately 100-200 advanced nuclear explosive devices. Officially, Israel has declared that it will not be the first to introduce nuclear weapons into the Middle East. Israel has not signed the NPT treaty.
* IRAN: Iran has been a non-nuclear-weapon state party to the NPT since 1970. It has a uranium enrichment program which it says is geared to providing energy so it can export more oil and gas. Western powers suspect Iran's underlying agenda is to develop the means to make atomic bombs because of its past failure to declare nuclear facilities to the U.N. nuclear watchdog and continued restrictions on U.N. inspections. Iran is under U.N. sanctions for refusing to suspend the disputed activity.
