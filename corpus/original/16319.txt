Summer bookings so far reflected the distinct wait-and-see attitude seen in the tourist industry, Club Med said on Thursday.
Added to this, the recent swine flu outbreak has also negatively impacted bookings mainly from travellers from Japan, China and the United States.
Club Med added, however, that summer bookings could still improve, pointing to possible late bookings and the impact of advertising campaigns.
Club Mediterranee last year announced spending and capacity cuts in response to a decline in bookings caused by the financial crisis, focusing on increasing its market share and strengthening its position as a global specialist in upmarket, multi-cultural vacations, especially in emerging growth markets.

On an operating level the group swung to a loss of 9 million euros against a profit of 5 million in the 2007-08 first half. Nevertheless, current operating profit in the leisure business grew to 28 million euros from 26 million.
Revenue per available bed, a key indicator of the business's move upmarket, rose 2.3 percent to 107.90 euros, led by a slightly higher occupancy rate and an average price increase of 3 percent.
"Against the backdrop of a global crisis, our winter 2009 results saw a new increase in the number of upmarket customers, as well as market share gains and an improvement in Village operating income, Chairman and Chief Executive Henri Giscard d'Estaing said in a statement.
