(Reuters) - Chile's Collahuasi copper mine, one of the country's top producers, said on Monday it estimates losses of around 20,000 tonnes of fine copper, or 5 percent of its annual output, after power problems.
The mine produced 415,000 tonnes of copper in concentrate last year and is one of the main mines in Chile, the world's top copper producer.
The red metal rose to its highest level since early October on Monday, fueled by optimism about growth in China, the world's top consumer. Copper for September delivery HGU9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division ended up 2.30 cents at $2.5450 a lb, after dealing in a session range from $2.5175 to $2.5790 -- its highest level since Oct. 3.
The mine, owned by Xstrata XTA.L and Anglo American (
), is 4,400 meters (14,400 feet) above sea level. Japanese consortium Mitsui & Co. is a minority stakeholder.
