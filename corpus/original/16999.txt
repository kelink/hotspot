(Reuters) - Morgan Stanley plans to raise $2.2 billion in common equity to bring it closer to repaying its TARP loans, the company said on Tuesday.
Selling the shares would help satisfy criteria for repaying the $10 billion it borrowed under the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program, the bank holding company said.
Some of the shares to be sold will be acquired by Morgan Stanley shareholders China Investment Corp and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc, it said.
While Morgan Stanley said approval to pay back TARP funds has not yet been granted, it hopes to make the repayment this month.
Morgan Stanley's announcement comes a day after JPMorgan Chase and American Express Co said they plan to sell common stock to position themselves to repay bailout funds.
Last month, Morgan Stanley -- which was required under the stress test to raise $1.8 billion -- sold $4.6 billion in stock and $4 billion in debt.
