Kuwait minister says China refinery talks not easy

(Reuters) - Kuwait's oil minister said on Tuesday that talks with industry and government officials in China had not been easy, as both sides try to reach a final agreement on a refinery in a southern Chinese city.
"Believe me, the discussion was not that easy. We have to find a way out," Sheikh Ahmad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, who is also chairman of state-run Kuwait Petroleum Corp, said during a visit to Beijing, though he did not specify the topic of the talks.
The refinery in Nansha, a suburb of Guangzhou, has been mired in controversy since a first agreement was signed in 2005.
Environmental concerns have already forced the facility out of Huangpu, another Guangzhou suburb, and media reports say it could now be moved again, requiring another round of assessments.
The planned facility includes a refinery that can process 15 million tonnes of Kuwaiti crude a year (300,000 bpd) and a one million tonne-per-year ethylene complex.
Environmentalists object that the proposed site is close to state protected wetlands and the densely populated and already polluted Pearl River Delta region, including Hong Kong and Macao.
The Kuwait-Chinese refinery and petrochemical project is expected to cost between $8 billion to $9 billion, Kuwaiti state news agency KUNA reported last August.
Al-Sabah said he had met officials from Chinese oil firms and Chinese Vice-Premier Li Keqiang, but did not elaborate.
Following the collapse in oil prices, Kuwait has plunged into a political and economic crisis, and projects worth at least $33 billion have been cancelled since December last year, including a $17 billion deal with Dow Chemical (
Kuwait is China's eighth-largest crude supplier in 2008, providing China 5.9 million tonnes of crude (118,000 bpd), or 3.3 percent of China's total imports last year.
Its crude exports to China hit 176,100 bpd in March, close to the 190,000 bpd peak touched back in August and September, but it may still struggle to reach a targetted 500,000 bpd without a foothold in the refining sector.
By 2015, KPC expects to supply between 500,000 and 700,000 barrels per day of crude to the Nansha plant and a second one in Quanzhou owned by a smaller firm, Sinochem (
