(Reuters) - No countries have officially notified the World Trade Organisation (WTO) of bans on imports of pork in the current swine flu outbreak, WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell said on Wednesday.
"We have not been formally notified of any measures," Rockwell told reporters.
The deadly outbreak of swine flu has led several countries to impose bans on pork imports, although it has so far infected people not pigs, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) says the disease cannot be caught from eating pig meat. [ID:nN2818017]
Russia, not a member of the WTO and therefore not liable to international trade disciplines, has banned meat imports from Mexico, the epicentre of the outbreak, as well as U.S. states where cases have been confirmed, and banned raw pork from several other U.S. states. [ID:nLS266773]
China, the world's biggest pork consumer, has banned imports of live pigs and pork from Mexico and the U.S. states of Texas, California and Kansas. Earlier this month China launched a trade dispute at the WTO against the United States over U.S. health-related restrictions on imports of Chinese chicken.
Ecuador, which is pressing other WTO members to approve a series of tariff increases it applied in January to defend its balance of payments, has banned imports of pigs and pork from the United States and Mexico, although the size of this trade is relatively small. [ID:nN28318439]
The European Union, where swine flu has spread to members Spain, Britain, Germany and Austria, says it has no plans to restrict imports from the United States. [ID:nLS30928] (For more Reuters stories on swine flu, click on [nFLU]) (For more Reuters swine flu coverage, please click here:
