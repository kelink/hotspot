(Reuters) - Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano of Spain and New Zealand's Mark Brown shared the lead on seven-under-par 65 after the Ballantine's Championship first round Thursday.
Fernandez-Castano, 28, runner-up at last week's China Open, notched six birdies plus an eagle three at the 10th as he and Brown finished a stroke ahead of Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee, local hope Kyung-Nam Kang and Dutchman Robert Jan-Derksen.
The Spaniard, the 2005 Rookie of the Year, has won four times on the European Tour.
Brown, who began at the 10th at the Pinx Golf Club, made a flying start with an eagle and later capped his round with a birdie at the last.
"I didn't play here last year so it's my first real look at it. I just played nice and steady," he told reporters.
Brown has won once on the European Tour at last year's Johnnie Walker Classic in India.
After parring the first hole, Thongchai produced a blistering run of four consecutive birdies before bogeying the sixth.
In joint sixth place on 67 were Briton Robert Dinwiddie, Jason Knutzon of the United States and Italian Alessandro Tadini.
