China not blocking fuel oil imports: official

(Reuters) - China has not stopped issuing import licenses for some grades of fuel oil, a Commerce Ministry official told Reuters on Monday, denying reports that it had.
"We are still issuing licenses. We haven't changed any of our policies at all. I think the confusion is due to some recent technical problems," said the official, who declined to be named.
CBI China, an energy consultancy, cited importers in eastern and southern China as saying the ministry had stopped issuing import licenses for grades of fuel oil covered by Customs code 27101929, which accounts for all grades apart from No. 5-7.
"We didn't see any government notice about the ban. The fact is that since the beginning of June, there were little or no imports of such fuel oil," a Shanghai-based trader told Reuters.
The grades covered by the customs code made up 13 percent of China's total fuel oil imports in the first four months of this year, according to data from China's customs office.
Imports of the grades have shown sharp monthly fluctuations this year, bouncing between about 100,000 tonnes in January and March and about 470,000 tonnes in February and April, while exports from China steadily grew between January and April.
Data for May is not yet available and will be issued later this month by China's Customs office.
China's top importers of the grades in 2008 were Brightoil Petroleum Group, Qingdao Yijia Economic & Trade Industry Import & Export Co Ltd and China Marine Bunker (PetroChina) Co Ltd, according to Xinhua OGP, an industry newsletter.
Fuel oil is mainly used by independent refiners as a feedstock, or as a fuel for some industrial users such as power stations and shipping companies.
