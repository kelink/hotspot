Global factory PMI points to stabilisation by mid-year

(Reuters) - Global factory activity fared better in May than preceding months across major economies as output contracted at a much less fierce pace in a heavy recession, a survey showed on Monday.
The global index, produced by JP Morgan with research and supply management organisations, rose to 45.3 in May from 41.8 in April. That was its highest level in nine months, but was still well below the 50.0 mark dividing growth from contraction.
Only the Chinese PMI among leading economies managed to hold above the 50.0 level, which it has managed for the last three months in a row, boosting markets eager for signs of global economic recovery.
"Although still in recession territory, the substantial gains in the output and new orders indexes, combined with a rising orders-to-inventory ratio, point to the trend in global manufacturing stabilising by mid-year," said David Hensley at JP Morgan.
The new orders index rose to 48.6 from 43.8 in April, its highest level in a year.
The index combines survey data from countries including the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia. (Editing by Andy Bruce)
