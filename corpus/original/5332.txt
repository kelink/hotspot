Taiwan local polls test pro-China party after shooting

(Reuters) - Taiwan voters go to the polls on Saturday to choose mayors of the island's biggest cities in a test of the popularity of the China-friendly ruling party ahead of the 2012 presidential race.
Whichever party wins most of the five races will have a clear shot at the presidency, and a strong performance by the anti-China opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)could stoke concern in Beijing.
Taiwan financial markets may slip in the short term if the DPP wins big on fears that the opposition's new clout might extend to the presidency and threaten trade deals with economic powerhouse China.
"Election results could weigh on sentiment," said Joanna Tan, economist with Forecast Ltd in Singapore. "ECFA is due for further talks next year, so that could delay the process."
Friday's shooting incident could generate sympathy votes for the KMT, analysts said
