UPDATE 4-Veolia Q1 falls less than feared, shares gain

(Reuters) - French utility Veolia (
) posted a lower underlying first-quarter operating profit on Thursday, as the economic downturn hit demand for waste services, but its shares rose as the result beat forecasts.
The world's largest water company by market capitalisation said recurring operating profit in the three months fell to 623 million euros ($827 million) from 698 million a year ago.
Operating cash flow -- which Veolia analysts call earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) -- fell 6.6 percent to 1.06 billion euros. A strong performance in water pushed sales up 4 percent to 9.23 billion euros.
"The EBITDA fall reflects the importance of fixed costs in waste management. However, it's less than expected," analysts at French broker Oddo Securities said in a research note.
Veolia's shares closed 1 percent higher at 21.87 euros.
But some analysts including Patrice Lambert de Diesbach at CM-CIC Securities said they kept a cautious stance on the stock, which tumbled 65 percent in 2008 on the back of profit warnings.
Diesbach said the waste management business remained "a cause for concern," while Sofia Savvantidou at Citigroup called a rise in Veolia's net debt to 16.8 billion euros on March 30, against 16.5 billion euros on Dec. 31, "not encouraging."
"These figures are in line with our expectations and consistent with our 2009 objectives," Thomas Piquemal, Veolia's recently-appointed financial director, told a conference call.
Veolia stuck with a target to generate free cash flow of around 2 billion euros this year, and said plans to generate 400 million euros in savings in 2009-2010, and trim investments, were "progressing in accordance with commitments".
Veolia carried out a 2.6 billion euro rights issue in June 2007 to replenish its coffers after the acquisition of Germany's Sulo for 1.45 billion euros, Britain's Cleanaway for 859 million euros, 75 percent of Italy's TMT for 338 million euros, and Thermal North America at an enterprise value of $788 million.
The Paris-based group's core water unit showed a 9.5 percent sales rise to 3.14 billion euros, helped by strong activity in China and new contracts in North America and the Middle East.
But waste management continued to lag, with sales down 7.8 percent to 2.23 billion euros as deteriorating economic conditions affected volumes of solid waste collected from industrial clients, the company said.
Piquemal said the situation in the division had stopped deteriorating in March. "A decrease in volumes has stabilised during the month of March ... We are being cautious," he said.
Impairment charges booked on its less-profitable waste division were the reason behind a halving in 2008 net profit. The group's two remaining businesses, energy and transport posted revenue increases of 8.7 percent to 2.4 billion euros and 5.4 percent to 1.5 billion euros, respectively.
