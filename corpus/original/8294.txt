(Reuters) - The global recession hit the world's biggest cement maker hard in the third quarter but Lafarge (
Reporting a sharp fall in sales and profits, Chief Executive Bruno Lafont said the global building materials market had shown signs of stabilisation in the quarter and that it would likely mark the bottom of the downturn.
But he warned that a recovery would have to wait till the second half of 2010, especially in mature markets like the United States, although emerging markets like China could come back sooner.
"I'm slightly positive but still cautious for 2010," he said during a conference call with analysts.
The French group's shares were down 3.7 percent at 55.84 euros at 1100 GMT, making it the biggest decliner in Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 .PGL.FTEU3 as sluggish results prompted investors to book recent hefty gains on the stock.
The shares are up 52 percent this year compared with a 24 percent rise for rival Holcim, and 27 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx European construction and materials sector index .SXOP.
Investors and analysts are closely watching the building materials sector for signs of economic recovery. Construction and infrastructure projects are often slowed during a recession, and financing is tougher to find.
Cement demand is strongly linked to economic activity, so an uptick in gross domestic product next year in major markets like the U.S. and China should benefit Lafarge and its competitors.

For cement makers, however, the picture for 2009 remains bleak. Lafarge said on Friday cement volumes would drop in its markets by 6 to 8 percent this year, darkening its previous outlook given in July for a drop of 4 to 8 percent. At the outset of 2009 Lafarge had said volumes would drop by 2 to 5 percent.
Its third-quarter revenue declined 20 percent to 4.252 billion euros ($6.31 billion), while analysts polled by Reuters had on average expected 4.623 billion euros.
Current operating profit in the quarter fell 28 percent to 852 million euros, which compared with a consensus forecast of 856.17 million euros.
Lafarge said its campaign to cut fixed costs, which account for about one third of costs in the cement business, was ahead of schedule.
The firm had said it would cut 400 million euros in fixed costs from 2009 to 2011. On Friday it said those cuts would be achieved ahead of schedule, by the end of 2010.
"We still have potential to cut costs so we will continue to do so but it's too early to say by how much," said Lafont.
Lafont also said that the group's plan to sell off 1 billion in assets this year was "on track" and that several deals were currently in negotiation.
The pace of asset disposals slowed in the third quarter, with only about 50 million euros-worth being sold in a series of smaller deals, bringing the year-to-date total to 800 million euros.
Lafarge competes with Mexico's CEMEX CMXCPO, Switzerland's Holcim (
