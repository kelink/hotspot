(Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Danaher Corp (
) just missed Wall Street expectations with a 14 percent decline in quarterly earnings on Thursday, citing a weak global economy, and cut its 2009 earnings forecast.
It also said it is speeding up cost cuts, and expects to eliminate 2,300 jobs and 14 facilities this year.
Danaher said none of its businesses was immune to a slowdown that has hit the United States, Western Europe and most emerging markets, though it said demand in China was down only modestly.
"Discretionary corporate and consumer spending remains weak, particularly at higher price points or commitment levels," Chief Executive Larry Culp told analysts on a conference call.
Danaher said its motion, test and measurement and cable businesses were being especially affected, while its medical technology businesses held up well. The motion business makes technology for making manufacturing operations more efficient, while its test and measurement products are used in communications, electronics and other industries.
Washington-based Danaher, which makes Craftsman tools as well medical and industrial technology like water quality systems, reported net earnings fell to $237.7 million, or 72 cents per share, from $276.5 million, or 83 cents per share, a year earlier.
Analysts, on average, expected profit of 73 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.
Revenue fell 13 percent to $2.63 billion, compared with Wall Street forecasts for sales of $2.68 billion.
Danaher said it expected 2009 earnings per share in a range of $3.30 to $3.70, compared with average Wall Street forecasts of $3.63. Its January forecast had called for full-year earnings of $3.70 to $4.10 per share.
The company said it has $900 million in cash and has completed a $750 million bond issue, which will help fund acquisitions.
"We believe the acquisition environment is becoming more attractive," Culp said.
Danaher shares were little changed at $55.05 in premarket trading. (Reporting by Nick Zieminski; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Dave Zimmerman)
