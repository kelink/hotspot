(Reuters) - Ethiopia sought on Thursday to reassure international firms exploring for oil and gas in its volatile Ogaden region that rebels were no longer active there.

"The so-called rebel warning against corporations engaged in exploration in the Ogaden is a falsehood. The ONLF has no capacity to threaten or attack facilities," Minister of Mines and Energy Alemayehu Tegenu said in a statement.

Even Petronas PETR.UL, the state-owned Malaysian company which has received direct ONLF threats in the past, was continuing its exploratory activity, Alemayehu said.

The ONLF rebels say they are fighting for self-determination for their home region, an arid land of mainly nomadic herders, but the government considers them a terrorist group supported by arch-foe Eritrea to destabilise the region.
