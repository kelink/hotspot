METALS-Copper spirals to 3-week low on demand concerns

(Reuters) - A stronger dollar and fears of waning near-term Chinese interest sent the price of copper into a sharp downward spiral on Monday to its lowest level since late May.
"The Chinese may have take a breather from buying physical copper as aggressively as they had up until now," said Mike Frawley, global head of metals with Newedge Financial Inc in New York.
"They have been the driver of this uptrend and if they curtail some of their buying interest, this set-back we are seeing now is not surprising at all," he added.
Copper for September delivery HGU9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division tumbled 11.75 cents, or 5.2 percent, to settle at $2.1440 a lb, its lowest level on a closing basis since May 27.
On the London Metal Exchange (LME), benchmark copper MCU3 sank $264, or 5.25 percent, to settle at $4,761 a tonne. In after-hours business the selling continued, pulling it down as low as $4,715.
"There is disillusionment over the green shoots recovery and there is a feeling generally that prices have overrun fundamentals," said Robin Bhar, an analyst at Calyon.
He added recent data had suggested economies were still in recession, while in copper specifically there was growing evidence that the Chinese market was oversupplied following strong imports this year.
Also reinforcing negative sentiment was a stronger dollar, which rose against the euro on concerns over the euro zone's economic and fiscal outlook. [USD/]
Prices of copper, used in power and construction, rose more than 70 percent to an eight-month high of $5,388 a tonne earlier this month, helped by Chinese stockpiling and improving economic data, but have since retreated.
China's copper imports also undermined sentiment. Imports hit a record for the fourth straight month in May, but apparent consumption fell 3.5 percent from the previous month, reflecting increased stockpiles. [ID:nHKG80221]
"Base metals couldn't get any positives from the Chinese customs data," said Eugen Weinberg, an analyst at Commerzbank. "It's not surprising because it's more or less in the price."
Data from the International Copper Study Group (ICSG) showing the world copper market in a 48,000-tonne surplus during the first quarter of 2009 provided further evidence of the market's weakened state of demand. [ID:nN22512379]
However, supporting prices are falling stocks of copper, which are at 277,600 tonnes from levels around 500,000 tonnes in early April.
Aluminum lost 6.4 percent to hit a two-week low of $1,572, and ended at $1,574 versus $1,679. The metal, used in transport and packaging, has risen more than 10 percent this month.
In other base metals, steel-making ingredient nickel MNI3 fell 5.2 percent to $14,400 a tonne and ended at $14,490 from $15,200, while battery material lead MPB3 eased almost 6 percent to a near three-week low at $1,595 from $1,695. It was last bid at $1,602.
Zinc MZN3 dropped 5.7 percent to $1,487 a tonne -- its lowest since May 29 -- and ended at $1,502 from $1,576, while tin MSN3 ended at $14,400 from $14,800.
