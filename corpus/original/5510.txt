(Reuters) - The United States told China on Saturday its wants Sino-Japanese tension over a territorial dispute to cool down and has proposed a U.S.-China-Japan meeting to help rebuild trust, a senior U.S. official said on Saturday.
"We have made very clear to both sides that we want the temperature to go down," the official told reporters after a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi.
The two met on the sidelines of the East Asia Summit in Hanoi, which has been overshadowed by the Sino-Japanese squabbling over the disputed Senkaku islands, called the Diaoyu islands in Chinese, in the East China Sea.
The senior U.S. official said Clinton told Yang the United States did not take a position on the ultimate sovereignty of the islands, but repeated that Washington believes they are covered by a 1960 U.S.-Japan security agreement.
"We suggested that the United States would be prepared to play a role in that overall effort," he said. "We have talked to the Japanese and the Chinese together about the idea of a trilateral between our three countries to underscore the importance of a strong and steady relationship among three."
Yang told Clinton China wished to be a "reliable supplier" of rare earth minerals, added the U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
