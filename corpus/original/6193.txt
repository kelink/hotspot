(Reuters) - Long-dated Japanese government bonds dipped on Monday as Tokyo stocks got a boost after China's weekend announcement that it will make the yuan more flexible, taken as a vote of confidence in the global economic recovery.
"The consensus in the bond market seems to be that China's latest move on the yuan will not have much impact," said Makoto Yamashita, chief Japan interest rate strategist at Deutsche Securities. "There is the experience from China's revaluation in 2005, when the subsequent rise in U.S. Treasury yields and the yen was short lived."
Underscoring market expectations that any appreciation by the yuan will be slow and modest, China's central bank on Monday kept the currency's daily mid-point against the dollar unchanged from Friday.
The five-year yield was unchanged at 0.395 percent, after hitting a seven-year low of 0.365 percent earlier in June.
The benchmark 10-year yield rose 1.5 basis points to 1.210 percent, after touching a six-month low of 1.190 percent late in May.
JGB yields have hovered near their recent troughs, with a sharp rises prevented by bargain hunting from domestic investors ranging from banks to pension funds wrong-footed after starting the fiscal year in April expecting yields to rise.
"Expectations of a global economic slowdown are pinning down yields, and supply-demand conditions remain favorable," said Yamashita at Deustche Securities.
Tokyo's Nikkei average
was up 1.8 percent after touching a one-month high following China's move.
