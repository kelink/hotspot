Zhongwang, Asia's biggest maker of aluminium extrusion products, raised $1.3 billion on April 30, making it at the time the world's largest IPO in nearly a year.

In a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange late on Monday, Zhongwang defended the accuracy of the prospectus and outlined the various efforts it has gone through to prove the reliability of the information.
