) posted a quarterly profit that failed to assuage investor worries about slowing growth in China, its biggest market.
Shares in the fast-food chain, whose third-quarter profit matched Wall Street's expectations, fell 1.9 percent in extended trading.
China -- the world's fastest growing major economy -- is Yum's biggest earnings driver, accounting for just over 40 percent of overall profits. But analysts say the slowdown might have accelerated this quarter.
Closely watched sales at Yum's established restaurants in China rose 19 percent in the third quarter, but those results only captured Yum's China operations through the end of August.

Sales at established restaurants in Yum Restaurants International (YRI) were up 3 percent during the third quarter. That division includes Yum's other non-U.S. markets such as France, India and Russia.
While Yum's business is robust in international markets, it continues to struggle at home.
Overall sales at U.S. restaurants open at least one year fell 3 percent. That result included declines of 2 percent at Taco Bell, 3 percent at Pizza Hut and 3 percent at KFC.
Operating profit was up in China and YRI, but down in the United States.
Yum's net income in the third quarter ended September 3 rose to $383 million, or 80 cents per share, from $357 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding special items, Yum's profit was 83 cents per share, matching analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Shares in Yum fell to $48.51 after closing at $49.44 on the New York Stock Exchange,
