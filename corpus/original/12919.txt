) is set to buy Royal Bank of Scotland's (

Talks are taking place in London and may conclude by early next week, the paper said.
The deal is likely to be announced in two weeks, it said citing a person close to the negotiations.
"We always look at opportunities in our footprint markets but, as you would expect, we don't comment on any specific opportunities we may be looking at," a Standard Chartered spokesperson told the paper.
"The sale process of the retail and commercial assets in Asia has advanced well; however, due to regulatory constraints and the confidentiality of the process, we will not comment on any individual bidders or elements of the transaction process until its completion," a RBS spokesperson told the paper.
RBS is selling its assets to shore up its balance-sheet after the bank was bailed out by the British government, which owns up to 70 percent of the banking group. RBS is seeking to exit from or shrink its operations in up to 36 countries.
