China to push compulsory insurance for polluting industries

(Reuters) - China will force heavily polluting industries to participate in a compulsory insurance program to ensure they can adequately provide compensation for damage, the government said on Thursday.
Companies that must participate in the scheme include mining and smelting industries, lead battery manufacturers, leather goods firms and chemical factories, the Environment Ministry and China Insurance Regulatory Commission said in a joint statement.
Petrochemical companies and firms that make hazardous chemicals and hazardous waste would also be encouraged to participate, it added.
Special environmental protection funds would be allocated to companies taking out the insurance, and they would be given priority for bank lending, the statement said.
Companies which don't apply for the insurance may face negative environmental impact assessments and credit downgrades, which could hamper their development, it added.
A pilot insurance program currently covered more than 2,000 companies across a dozen provinces and had underwritten some 20 billion yuan ($3.21 billion) in risk, the government departments said.
"Using the tool of insurance ... is conducive towards pushing companies to raise their environmental risk management and reduce incidents of polluting accidents," it added.
The insurance scheme follows a spate of rules aimed at cleaning up the country's notoriously filthy environment.
The issue has sprung back in focus during a particularly smoggy winter that has renewed widespread concern over China's environmental problems.
