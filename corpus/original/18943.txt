(Reuters) - New local-currency loans extended by Chinese banks might have fallen to more than 600 billion yuan ($88 billion) in April from a record monthly high of 1.89 trillion yuan in March, the official China Securities Journal said on Tuesday.
The figure would still be around a 30 percent increase on the 469 billion yuan in the new yuan loans in April 2008, according to the earlier data by the Chinese central bank, as Chinese banks respond to a government appeal to lend more.
Analysts have said fears that a surge in China's bank lending in the first quarter of this year will lead to a credit drought later in the year look overdone as the overall supply of liquidity is far more stable than any coming headline swings might suggest. [ID:nPEK70022]
"Although new loans fell sharply month on month in April, market watchers believe the scale and growth were more reasonble than in the first three months," the newspaper said, quoting unnamed banking sources.
Chinese banks extended quarterly record new yuan loans of 4.58 trillion yuan in the January-March period, 3.25 trillion yuan more than the same period of last year and nearly hitting the government's full-year target of 5 trillion yuan for 2009.
The newspaper said China's Big Four state-owned banks lent more than 250 billion yuan in April while smaller banks and other financial institutions lent a combined around 400 billion yuan.
