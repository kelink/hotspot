SHANGHAI, June 8
), China's first listed non-state lender, said it plans to issue shares in Hong Kong, which could raise an estimated 20 billion yuan ($2.93 billion). The bank will issue up to 15 percent of its expanded capital, it said on Saturday, or up to 3.32 billion shares. There will be a greenshoe option to increase the issue by an additional 15 percent.
The move revives a Hong Kong listing plan first announced by the company in 2003 that was eventually scrapped in favour of a private placement carried out in June 2007, which raised 18.2 billion yuan, the paper said.
The bank's Shanghai-listed shares have risen nearly 80 percent since the start of the year, while the mainland's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index
is up more than 50 percent and the Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index
up 30 percent, buoyed in part by prospects for an early recovery in China's economy.
Minsheng Bank's shares ended Friday trade in Shanghai at 7.27 yuan.
It will use the funds to supplement its core capital, boost its capital adequacy ratio, and increase its profitability and its ability to withstand risk.
The bank's capital adequacy ratio at the end of 2008 was 9.22 percent, down from 10.73 percent a year earlier. (Reporting by Edmund Klamann; Editing by Jonathan Hopfner)
