) is considering trimming its 2012 group-wide production plan by about 2 percent because of a drop in sales in China after a territorial row, a Japanese newspaper reported, but the company denied it had altered its target.
Asia's top automaker may cut its calendar-year production forecast for 10.05 million vehicles by around 200,000 vehicles, the Mid-Japan Economist newspaper said on its website on Thursday, without citing sources. The regional daily is based in central Japan, where Toyota's headquarters is located.
"The figure cited in the report is not based on anything announced by us, and at this time there are no changes to the figures we presented earlier," said Toyota spokeswoman Shino Yamada.

Toyota and its two local Chinese partners saw sales drop 48.9 percent in September from a year earlier to 44,100 vehicles.
A source previously told Reuters that Toyota's production cutbacks in China were likely to extend through November, a move that would almost certainly put the company's goal of selling 1 million cars in China this year out of reach.
Toyota, whose sales in China accounted for about 12 percent of its total global vehicle sales in 2011, is less exposed to the world's biggest auto market than rivals Nissan Motor Co (
Analysts have said that Japanese automakers could see a dent in sales in China for months. Takaki Nakanishi, an auto analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, said that the impact could last three months in an optimistic scenario and up to six months in a pessimistic scenario.
