(Reuters) - Thailand's leading satellite operator, Thaicom PCL THCOM.BK, said on Thursday it expected to return to a net profit in the second quarter thanks to rising revenue from new markets such as Japan and Malaysia.
"Our performance should improve in the second quarter in terms of both revenue and profit. We are launching services in new markets which should deliver more revenue," Chief Financial Officer Tanadit Charoanchan told reporters.
The company launched a high-speed Internet services via its broadband satellite IPSTAR in Malaysia and Japan earlier this year, and planned to offer similar services in Indonesia later this month, Tanadit said.
Thaicom, which on Wednesday reported a net loss of 220 million baht ($6.4 million) for the first quarter, expected to sell 70,000-80,000 user terminals for its broadband satellite IPSTAR service this year, up from 60,000 last year, he said.
IPSTAR's terminal equipment consists of an indoor modem for connection to the Internet, voice service and an antenna to send and receive signals and data to users.
The $400 million IPSTAR, launched in August 2005, had been expected to drive earnings at Thaicom, but progress in penetrating markets in China and India had been disappointing, analysts said.
Tanadit said the company was confident IPSTAR would break even this year as planned, which should help Thaicom make a net profit for the whole of 2009 after a net loss in 2008.
Thaicom was founded by former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. His relatives sold their controlling stake in Shin Corp SHIN.BK, which owns 41 percent of Thaicom, to Singapore's Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL] in 2006.
At the midday break, Thaicom shares were down 7.11 percent as profit-takers locked in cash after a surge of more than 30 percent over the last month. The overall Thai stock market was 3.3 percent lower. ($1=34.57 Baht) (Reporting by Manunphattr Dhanananphorn; Writing by Khettiya Jittapong; Editing by Alan Raybould)
