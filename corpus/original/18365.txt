(Reuters) - The U.S. dollar dropped to a four-month low on Tuesday as economic data bolstered the view that the global recession is easing and dented safe-haven demand for the greenback.
Stronger-than-expected UK retail sales, housing market and industrial production data pushed sterling up well over 1 percent versus the dollar, while the euro hit a seven-week high above $1.37.
"In general, market participants seem to be subscribing to the 'green shoots of recovery' theory," said Samarjit Shankar, director of global foreign exchange strategy at the Bank of New York Mellon in Boston. "If risk appetite remains in place, the dollar is likely to continue to weaken."
In mid-morning trading in New York, the ICE Futures U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.6 percent on the day, having hit 81.998, the lowest since early January .DXY.
The euro rose to a seven-week high of $1.3706, according to Reuters data. It was last up 0.5 percent at $1.3643
, extending gains after news the U.S. trade gap widened less than expected in March boosted risk appetite. [ID:nN11541619]
Against the yen, the euro erased earlier gains to trade 0.4 percent lower at 131.81 yen EURJPY= and the dollar fell 0.9 percent to 96.62 yen
after sliding to 96.53 yen, the lowest since late April.
Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT Forex in New York, attributed the selloff in dollar/yen to broad-based pressure on the greenback and currency hedging by Japanese exporters. She said the dollar/yen pair is also approaching key technical levels.
