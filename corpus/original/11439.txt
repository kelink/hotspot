Iran still not fully cooperative on nukes: U.S.

(Reuters) - Iran is still not fulfilling obligations related to its nuclear activities, despite allowing U.N. inspectors to visit a reactor and upgraded monitoring at a uranium enrichment plant, a U.S. official said on Friday.
Iran allowed International Atomic Energy Agency officials to inspect the site of the Arak heavy water reactor last week, diplomats said. The agency sought to verify the facility is being used for peaceful purposes only.
"As far as Iran allowing this improved surveillance and access, Iran is still not in compliance with its IAEA obligations and is not providing what has been called for, and that is full and comprehensive cooperation," the Obama administration official said.
"If Iran's going to restore international confidence in its nuclear program, it needs to provide that kind of cooperation," the official said on condition of anonymity.
Western nations suspect Tehran of trying to develop nuclear weapons, but Iran says its nuclear program is peaceful.
The United States, Britain, France and Germany are expected to urge Russia and China in talks on September 2 to consider a fourth round of U.N. sanctions on Iran and the latest IAEA report will help form the basis for the discussions.
