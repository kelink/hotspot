(Reuters) - China's Citic Group has yet to decide whether to launch a counterbid for Australian coal miner Macarthur Coal Ltd MCC.AX, which is the subject of a $5 billion hostile takeover from ArcelorMittal SA (
Citic Group, together with subsidiary Citic Resources Holdings Ltd (
), owns about 24 percent of Macarthur, making it the single largest shareholder of the world's biggest producer of pulverized and cleaner burning coal.
"It is not yet time to show our stance (on Peabody's offer)," Citic Group Chairman Chang Zhenming told reporters on Friday. He did not elaborate.
Macarthur shares fell 1.2 percent to A$15.32 on Friday, below the ArcelorMittal/Peabody offer price of A$15.66 per share, including a 16 cent dividend.
ArcelorMittal and Peabody opened their takeover for shareholder acceptance on Thursday, after Macarthur rejected the offer. Macarthur has told shareholders not to take any action on the offer until it sends out its formal response in the next two weeks.
Separately, Citic Group said it had not yet set a timetable for an initial public offering, Chang said.
Last year, media reports said CITIC Group was considering a $12 billion listing in Hong Kong in 2011, a move that could help the state-owned conglomerate raise its profile and cut debt.
"We are still working on an internal restructuring ... we don't have a timetable yet," he added.
