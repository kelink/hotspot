INSTANT VIEW: U.S. jobless claims rise in latest week
2009-07-30 08:54:00.0
(Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits rose slightly more than expected last week, but a gauge of underlying labor trends fell for a fifth straight week, government data showed on Thursday.
KEY POINTS: * Initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits rose 25,000 to a seasonally adjusted 584,000 in the week ended July 25. * The four-week moving average for new claims, considered to be a better gauge of underlying trends as it smoothes out week-to-week volatility, fell by 8,250 to 559,000. * This was the lowest level since late January. The weekly moving average has declined for five straight weeks. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast new claims rising to 570,000 from a previously reported 554,000. * The number of people staying on the benefit rolls after collecting an initial week of aid fell by 54,000 to 6.20 million in the week ended July 18, the latest week for which the data is available. * This was the lowest since early April and marked the third straight week that this measure had declined.
RICHARD DEKASER, PRESIDENT, WOODLEY PARK RESEARCH, WASHINGTON:
"The seasonally adjusted figures were artificially elevated in May and June and artificially depressed in July. I think after you work through the seasonally forces and auto layoffs, weekly jobless claims are running in a 550,000 and 570,000 range.
"As for the July payroll figure, to be sure, it will still be a large loss, we haven't turned the corner yet. A pattern of diminished loss is the best we can hope for right now."
DOUG ROBERTS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CHANNEL CAPITAL RESEARCH, SHREWSBURY, NEW JERSEY:
"That's more than expected, jobless claims came in worse than expected. The indication there is that the problem isn't' over yet for a lot of the economy. Right now we probably have good earnings comparisons, but what you're starting to see is the economic news, and that is going to put even more focus on the GDP numbers.
"If you go back to 2002 bear market, you have to be very careful when you say that the recession ends, because it very well may be ending, but the market didn't start to pick up until unemployment started to go down at the end of 2003. Basically the unemployment number is not good news. Unless you have a huge stimulus package, you're going to find that in essence joblessness will have to come down for the economy to improve on a continuous basis and for consumer spending to reactivate, because if someone is uncertain of their job prospects, they are unlikely to go spend money."
HUGH JOHNSON, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, JOHNSON ILLINGTON ADVISORS, ALBANY, NEW YORK:
"Jobless claims are an important number because even though each week is an important number, the four-week moving average is a leading indicator of employment. As such, these numbers are consistent with the view that the economy, as measured by employment, continues to lose jobs, or recede, but perhaps at a slower pace. Clearly as measured by employment conditions, we are not, as yet, out of the woods. So for those that say the recession has ended, at least as measured by employment, that is not true."
DAVE ROVELLI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, U.S. EQUITY TRADING, CANACCORD ADAMS, NEW YORK:
"The number looks worse, but the continuing is better and it hasn't affected the stock market.
"It's seasonal so ... I'm more interested in what's going to happen in September, October when everybody's back at work and summer's over. If people don't see the recession coming to an end, they're going to start laying off more people and you're going to see more initial jobless claims."
SCOTT BROWN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, ST PETERSBURG, FLORIDA:
"Jobless claims were pretty close to expectations, with a lot of seasonal noise this time of year. But it looks like we are coming toward the end of the July seasonal noise and coming through that claims may settle at a somewhat lower level, under 600,000. That's still extremely high but better than it was earlier in the year."
LEE OLVER, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, SMH CAPITAL, HOUSTON:
MATTHEW STRAUSS, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, RBC CAPITAL, TORONTO:
"The headline number in the jobless claims report was slightly worse than expected, but the continuing claims component was getting better so that bodes well for the U.S. economy going forward. And that has provided support for the dollar against the yen."
