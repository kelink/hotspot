Clinics are also banned from locking up subjects or otherwise limiting their physical freedom, the country's health ministry said in regulations posted on its Web site. Multiple subjects in China, including the 15-year-old boy who was later beaten and died, have reportedly been sent for solitary confinement at Internet addiction clinics in recent months.
But the health ministry regulations said Internet addiction is not yet well-defined and that it should not be used as a label for harm caused by excessive Internet use. The ministry also recently banned the use of shock treatment for Internet addiction after accounts appeared online of the practice at a hospital in eastern Shangdong province. Staff at the notorious hospital tied down subjects and forced them to admit faults while receiving shocks for up to 30 minutes at a time, according to posts in online forums by people claiming to have received the treatment.
