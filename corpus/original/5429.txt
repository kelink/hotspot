Argentina negotiates with China over corn exports

(Reuters) - Argentina's farm minister said on Friday it is in talks with China over exporting corn to the Asian country, which does not currently buy Argentine corn due to curbs on genetically modified varieties.
Argentina is the world's second-biggest corn supplier after the United States. Rumors swirled earlier this year that China had bought Argentine corn, but no shipments were confirmed.
Genetically modified strains account for about 80 percent of the South American country's corn production, which is expected to reach a record 26 million tonnes in the current 2010/11 crop season.
"A sanitary protocol is being discussed that would give our country access to the Chinese market," Argentine Agriculture Minister Julian Dominguez said in a statement after talks with Chinese officials.
China, already the top buyer of Argentine soybeans, will import some 5 million tonnes of corn in 2011 -- up 150 percent from this year, the statement said.
Argentina's government grants export permits only once it has registered sufficient stocks to cover domestic demand, but Dominguez told reporters on Friday officials would "immediately" authorize corn export permits.
"This is what we've discussed with the president (Cristina Fernandez) because there is an international market with prices that are favorable," he said.
