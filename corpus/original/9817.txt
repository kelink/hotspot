) said on Thursday it expects to recognize a loss of about $1.4 billion on the sale of Nan Shan Life Insurance Co, its life insurance unit in Taiwan.
AIG agreed on Tuesday to sell the unit to two little-known buyers for $2.15 billion, marking the largest disposal since a U.S. government bailout saved the insurer from collapse last year.
Primus Financial, a firm founded by Citigroup Inc's (
) former Asia investment banking head, together with China Strategic Holdings (
), are to buy Nan Shan Life.
AIG expects to meet the criteria for "held-for-sale" accounting with respect to Nan Shan and recognize the loss, which is net of taxes, in the fourth quarter, it said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
AIG is undergoing a broad restructuring as it tries to pay back the U.S. government, which had to commit about $180 billion in taxpayer funds to pull the insurer back from the brink during the height of the financial crisis.
AIG's shares were up 74 cents, or 1.7 percent, at $45.15 during late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Paritosh Bansal; Editing by Tim Dobbyn) (For more M&A news and our DealZone blog, go to
