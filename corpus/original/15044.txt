), but few analysts expect a significant batch of them to be traded anytime soon on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
Even so, analysts said on Wednesday that the fact that a huge amount of yuan-denominated A shares in the country's largest foreign exchange lender could be freely floated might have a psychological impact on the stock market.
Bank of China's Shanghai-listed shares opened down 0.67 percent on Wednesday.
The locked-up shares are owned by the state-owned financial firm Central Huijin, an arm of China Investment Corp (CIC), the country's $200 billion sovereign wealth fund. It holds the state's stakes in about 10 banks and brokerages as a long-term strategic investor.
Central Huijin announced last September that it would buy more of the bank's shares over the next 12 months to support the sagging stock market at that time, Bank of China said in a statement published in the official Shanghai Securities News.
"During the (12-month) period, Central Huijin will not sell shares in our bank," it said in the statement.
By Monday, Bank of China would have a total of freely traded 177.82 billion Shanghai-listed A shares, or 70.05 percent of its outstanding shares, it said in the statement. Hong Kong-listed H shares would account for the remaining 29.95 percent stake.
That means all its shares would be free to float, it said.
China's stock market plunged 65 percent last year, hit by the global financial crisis and heavy profit-taking after it jumped around sixfold in the previous two years. The government took a slew of market-boosting steps last year, including ordering Central Huijin to buy more shares on the secondary market.
However, the country's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index
has jumped 63 percent so far this year, propelled by signs of an economic recovery.
Bank of China's Shanghai A shares have also risen 51 percent this year to close at 4.49 yuan on Tuesday, creating huge book returns for Central Huijin, which is believed to have bought the lender's shares on the secondary market far below 4.0 yuan.
