China opposes yuan reference by G20: sources

(Reuters) - Some G20 countries want to praise China's decision to alter its foreign exchange system in a leaders' summit communique this weekend, but China opposes the idea of any mention of its currency, G20 sources said.
"It was discussed in terms of welcoming the move," one source said. "The Chinese did not want a reference to it, and there was no language on urging a real appreciation."
A second source, a G20 official involved in the summit preparations, said that during negotiations over the communique on Friday delegates congratulated China for its move on the yuan, but some countries stressed the importance of Beijing going further toward a more flexible currency.
Even if China is not mentioned explicitly in the communique, G20 countries might include a less-specific reference to the importance of flexible currencies in the statement, the second source said.
The yuan ended the week 0.5 percent stronger against the U.S. dollar after the People's Bank of China's move.
Cui Tiankai, China's main negotiator in the pre-G20 discussions, said a week ago the yuan was a sovereign issue for China and should not be discussed in international forums.
That indicated Beijing would be uncomfortable in setting a precedent of having the yuan named by the G20, even if the line in the communique was intended to praise the depegging.
The United States wants China to allow the yuan to rise more rapidly to narrow a yawning trade deficit that has become a political headache for President Barack Obama's administration. Some lawmakers want the administration to formally accuse China of manipulating its currency, potentially opening the door to a trade war.
