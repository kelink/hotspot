European shares rise, led by commodities

(Reuters) - European shares rose at midday on Wednesday, the first day of the third quarter, with commodities gaining after positive Chinese economic data was released.
By 1116 GMT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300
index of top shares was up 1.2 percent at 859.93 points. The European benchmark rose 15.9 percent in the second quarter, after hitting a lifetime low on March 9.
The second-quarter rally came to a halt in mid-June and the FTSEurofirst has remained range-bound since then. Strategists have pointed to a lack of evidence of economic recovery, relative to the strength of the rally.
"We started the third quarter feeling a little more content that the worst is behind us," said Howard Wheeldon, strategist at BGC Partners in London.

"There is a more positive sense emerging from world economy in the eastern area. There is a lot of hope and anticipation in the West. Yes, we are bottoming, but we are not starting to see a recovery yet so we can't talk about growth until we see a recovery," Wheeldon said.
