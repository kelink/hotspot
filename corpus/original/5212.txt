) will oversee the investment of $5 billion to build 35 new Sheraton hotels by 2013 -- half of them in China, the company told Reuters.
Of that $5 billion, about two-thirds will be spent outside the United States, said Hoyt Harper, Sheraton's vice-president, in an interview.
The new spending caps the $6 billion the company has already spent overhauling Sheraton, and signals the importance of Starwood's oldest and largest brand even as it focuses on its operations outside the U.S.
Like its rivals, Starwood is vigorously pursuing growth in China. But Starwood has made international expansion its main selling point in recent years, even hosting its most recent earnings conference call from Beijing.
The company has 34 Sheratons planned for Greater China -- which includes Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and Mongolia -- over the next several years, slightly more than half its current portfolio of 65 hotels there.
Marriott has 41 hotels in China but has a market capitalization of $15.21 billion compared with Starwood's $11.58 billion.
"China is a growth story" for hoteliers, said Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Woronka. "It's still fairly early in the game. It's about distribution, it's about getting their brands in the right places over there.
The $5 billion will build only new hotels and does not include the millions that will be spent to renovate Beijing's Sheraton Great Wall, the first non-Chinese hotel built on the mainland, Harper said. The hotel's upgrade will begin in the middle of 2011 and end the following year.
