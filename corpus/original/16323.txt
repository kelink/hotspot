(Reuters) - Pilots at UAL Corp UAUA.O, parent of United Airlines, asked the White House on Wednesday to delay expected government approval of an application by the carrier and Continental Airlines Inc CAL.N for immunity from some antitrust law provisions.
The Air Line Pilots Association union is seeking labor protections as part of any immunity package that would permit the airlines to share pricing, scheduling and other information within the Star Alliance.
"We are requesting a delay or an approval with conditions to the application, union chief Steve Wallach wrote in a letter to President Barack Obama. "We are not opposed to the alliance itself. However, we are concerned that this application does not adequately address the very real threats to American workers' jobs."
United disputed the pilots' contention in a statement. "This is about adding an American company into an immunized alliance that will continue to protect American jobs - to suggest otherwise is a mischaracterization of the facts," the company said.
An immunity grant would bring Continental into the alliance, which includes US Airways Group Inc (
), Deutsche Lufthansa AG (
), Air Canada (
), Air China Ltd (
), Thai Airways International PCL THAI.BK and several other carriers.
The Transportation Department earlier this year granted provisional approval to the United and Continental application, pending review of public comments. The agency is expected to soon render a final decision.
On Monday, influential senators on antitrust matters urged Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and Attorney General Eric Holder to delay a decision until antitrust enforcers had a full opportunity to review the matter.
