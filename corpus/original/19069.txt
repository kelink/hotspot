(Reuters) - Mexico's government recommended on Saturday that its citizens stay away from China after Chinese authorities imposed a quarantine on a Hong Kong hotel where a Mexican guest fell ill with the new flu virus.
"We are especially worried about China, where Mexican citizens showing no signs at all of being ill, have been isolated, under unacceptable conditions," Espinosa told a news conference.
"The Foreign Ministry recommends avoiding traveling to China until these measures are corrected," she added.
Espinosa also criticized four Latin American countries -- Argentina, Peru and Ecuador and Cuba -- for suspending flights from Mexico over the flu alert.
The quarantining of the Hong Kong hotel occurred on Friday and the virus has spread to at least 17 countries around the world. (Reporting by Adriana Barrera, Writing by Pascal Fletcher; (Editing by Peter Cooney) (Mexico newsroom: +52 55 5282 7147))
