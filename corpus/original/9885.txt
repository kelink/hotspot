(Reuters) - Industrial distributor W.W. Grainger (
) posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped mainly by a one-time gain, but said its revenue continued to decline in the United States.
Third-quarter sales in the United States declined 14 percent to $1.40 billion, while Canada sales fell 13 percent to $166.3 million.
Sales for other businesses, which include Mexico, India, Puerto Rico, China and Panama, grew 11 percent versus the prior year, the company said in a statement.
"While daily sales remain stable, we are not yet seeing a catalyst for a sustained economic turnaround in any of our major end markets. We expect comparisons to improve as sales fell in the fourth quarter last year," Chief Executive James Ryan said.
Grainger, which has a 3,922-page catalog and sells almost everything from abrasives to refrigerants to vaccuum valves, said it continues to add more products and will have about 300,000 of them in the 2010 catalog.
For the third quarter, the company reported earnings of $144.6 million, or $1.88 a share, compared with $140 million, or $1.77 a share in the year-ago period.
The company said the third-quarter results included a one-time gain of 37 cents a share following its acquisition of a controlling stake in Japan's MonotaRO Co Ltd.
Analysts on average expected earnings of $1.34 a share, excluding items, on revenue of $1.6 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Separately, Grainger said it acquired Imperial Supplies LLC from American Capital Ltd (
) in an all-cash deal to explore cross selling opportunities, and expects the deal to add to earnings by 3 cents to 5 cents a share in 2010.
Struggling private-equity lender American Capital, which is in default of debt covenants, has been aggressively selling assets in its portfolio to generate capital to improve liquidity and reduce debt load.
Shares of Grainger were down 3 percent at $91.94 late morning Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Bijoy Koyitty in Bangalore; Editing by Unnikrishnan Nair)
