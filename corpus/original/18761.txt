(Reuters) - Cathay Financial (
), Taiwan's top listed financial holding firm, on Wednesday said it plans to invest T$100 billion ($3 billion) in China stocks and real estate when Taiwan permits such investments.
Cathay, with $66.7 billion in its investment portfolio, is the first Taiwan financial company announcing such plans, in the latest sign of warming ties between Taiwan and its former Cold War political rival China.
"We are all set to make the investments," president Chen Tsu-pei told an investor conference. "We're waiting for Taiwan regulators to disclose investment limits and categories."
Most forms of investment in China are currently closed to Taiwan financial institutions such as Cathay. But relations between the two have improved significantly under a year-old China-friendly administration, leading both sides to pledge to open many of their financial markets to each other.
In related news, Cathay said it reaped a first-quarter return of 4.6 percent for its portfolio, which includes local and overseas stocks and bonds. No year-ago figure was available.
The company had T$126.3 billion invested in Taiwan's property market in the year's first three months, accounting for 5.7 percent of the portfolio.
Cathay posted a T$5 billion net profit in the March quarter, swinging from a net loss of T$6 billion a year earlier, in part because it benefitted from gains of the local stock market.

The banking and insurance sub-index .TFNI ended up 4.57 percent on Wednesday, extending its rally to 68 percent since hitting a recent low on March 2. Taiwan's broader market
soared 41 percent during the same period, making it the world's fifth-best performer.
