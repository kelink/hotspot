(Reuters) - China's Benchmark stock index opened up on Thursday, led by Yangtze Power (
), after state media said the stock regulator had approved several mutual funds this week in quiet support to the market, which has dropped 20 percent over the past two weeks.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission granted approval to three exchange traded funds (ETFs) to trade Chinese stock indexes and to two stock-oriented funds over the past several days, media reports said.
opened up 0.48 percent at 2,798.37 points after closing at its lowest level in two months on Wednesday.
Traders said retail investors, which account for about 60 percent of daily turnover of the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses, had rushed to trim their positions this week amid a panic sparked by the unexpected downward momentum of the market's tumble.
China's young institutional investors, which are dominated by mutual funds and have yet to develop into a true pillar of the market, also took profits on positions built earlier this year at much lower levels.
"After the index breached a series of key technical barriers earlier this week, sentiment will decide the market's near-term trend," said Xu Yinhui, senior stock analyst at Guotai Junan Securities in Shanghai.
"Shorts and longs are expected to fight a fierce battle ahead of the index's half-year moving average," which is now just above 2,700, Xu said, adding that the mutual fund news should give only limited support to the overall market.
