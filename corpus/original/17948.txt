(Reuters) - The presidential hopeful of Brazil's ruling party, Dilma Rousseff, was hospitalized early on Tuesday with pain in her legs, doctors said, weeks after she announced she was being treated for cancer.
Rousseff, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's chief of staff, was given intravenous anesthetics and was undergoing more tests after an initial exam showed normal results, doctors at Sirio-Libanes hospital in Sao Paulo said in a statement.
Her hospitalization was likely to raise more doubts about whether Rousseff's health will allow her to bid for the country's top job in the October 2010 election.
Lula hand-picked Rousseff and his ruling Workers' Party endorsed her candidacy earlier this year, although she has not said whether she would run.
Her chemotherapy was scheduled to last four months, a period that could be crucial for her to negotiate support as she tries to claw back from trailing in early opinion polls.
A likely challenger in the 2010 poll is Sao Paulo state Governor Jose Serra of the opposition Brazilian Social Democracy Party, or PSDB. Serra, 66, lost to Lula in the 2002 presidential race but leads Rousseff by about 30 percentage points in opinion polls.
The opposition has become emboldened as a sharp economic downturn has begun to chip away at Lula's high popularity ratings. Last week it launched a congressional inquiry into alleged tax and procurement irregularities at the state-owned oil company Petrobras (
). The probe could put the government, which suffered several corruption scandals in recent years, on the defensive.
