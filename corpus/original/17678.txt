Track China's Leaders

Pelosi, a Democrat, said Friday that a bipartisan group of House members will be on the trip. However she did not provide details.
"It is the purpose of the trip to follow up on meetings that we have had here with representatives of China's government on the subjects of climate change and energy and how that relates to our economy," Pelosi told reporters.
Pelosi's visit comes on the heels of the House Energy and Commerce Committee approving a climate change bill late on Thursday that would reduce U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels by the year 2020.
While leaders around the world, including U.S. President Barack Obama, are hoping to sign a new global climate change pact in Copenhagen in December, it is unclear whether China will take on an aggressive role in curbing the pollutants.
Under the existing Kyoto Protocol on reducing carbon emissions, China and other developing countries have been held to less stringent standards. That has prompted Republican opponents in the United States to cap and trade to argue that it would encourage U.S. firms to shift more of their operations abroad.
