(Reuters) - Private home sales in Singapore soared to a record high for the second straight month in July, indicating increased confidence and speculation in the city-state's property market, government data showed on Monday.
The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) website showed developers sold 2,767 private homes in July, smashing the previous monthly record of 1,825 units that was set in June.
Mohamed Ismail, CEO of PropNex, a real estate broker, noted that over 40 percent of sales involved mid to higher-tier homes costing above S$1,000 ($692) per square foot, indicating the boom was no longer restricted to cheaper apartments.
The higher selling prices were also "a result of developers reacting to consumers' demand and raising the prices," he added.
