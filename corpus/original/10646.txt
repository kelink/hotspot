(Reuters) - World number four Elena Dementieva admitted to getting goose bumps when she returned to the scene of her greatest triumph for this week's $4.5 million China Open.
"Every time I come to the locker room I feel like goose bumps on my skin. It's very emotional to come back here," the fourth seeded Russian told a news conference on Saturday.
"I remember everything about one year ago. It was like yesterday, so fresh all memories from the Olympics. I just feel very excited being here one more time."
Dementieva, twice a grand slam losing finalist, was the winner of the China Open in 2003 in Shanghai before its relocation to the capital city the following year.
The event has been moved to the Olympic venue this year and revamped as a WTA "crown jewel," mandatory for the top 47 players.
Men's Olympic champion Rafael Nadal of Spain has also confirmed his re-appearance on the 10,000-seater center court next week, while women's doubles gold medalists Venus and Serena Williams are both in the singles draw.
