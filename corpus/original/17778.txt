Sweden's Ericsson (
) expanded its lead as its closest rival Nokia Siemens Networks [NSN.UL] lost share, researcher dell'Oro said on Thursday.
The telecom equipment market has seen cut-throat competition for new business during the past few years, driven by Asian vendors, and the outlook remains tough.
Dell'Oro said in January-March the market contracted 9 percent from a year ago. Alcatel-Lucent has forecast the market to shrink 8-12 percent in 2009, while Nokia Siemens has said the market would fall some 10 percent.
The world's top mobile network equipment maker, Ericsson, increased its share slightly to 33 percent share of the market in January-March, while the market share of Nokia Siemens Networks dropped to 21 percent from 24 percent a year ago, dell'Oro said.
Huawei roughly doubled its market share to 15 percent, while Alcatel-Lucent's share fell to 14 percent from 16 percent.
