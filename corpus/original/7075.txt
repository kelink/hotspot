Factbox: How China and Taiwan square off militarily
2010-01-31 12:56:00.0
(Reuters) - The military balance between China and Taiwan has rapidly shifted in China's favor, but a U.S. proposal on Friday to sell advanced arms to the island that Beijing claims as its own would shore up its self-defense.
Despite improved political ties following the election in Taiwan of a more pro-China president last year, China has yet to renounce the use of force to recover the self-ruled island it considers its sovereign territory. The mainland holds a strong lead over long-time political rival Taiwan despite the U.S. arms proposal.
Following is a brief comparison between China's and Taiwan's military forces:
Personnel 2.3 million* 277,765
- China's 2.3 million-strong armed forces are far bigger than the world's second-largest military, that of the United States, whose forces number about 1.5 million. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) was born out of the Red Army, a five-million-strong peasant army, which swept the Communists to power in 1949.
Soviet expertise helped organize it into a mass army geared toward wars of attrition during the 1950s, when it fought in the 1950-1953 Korean War alongside North Korea. The PLA is morphing into a modern force capable of fighting short, high-intensity conflicts against high-tech adversaries.
- With U.S. military aid, Taiwan transformed its army from the defeated remnants of the Nationalist forces that fled to the island in 1949 into a modern, disciplined military that has recently downsized in favor of improved technology.
Fighter aircraft more than 2,000 about 400
- China used to rely on somewhat substandard copies of Soviet-made aircraft, but these days has developed a more formidable design capacity. Its most advanced aircraft, and for Taiwan the potentially most threatening, are Russian Su-30 and Su-27 fighters.
- The backbone of Taiwan's air force is made up of U.S.-made F-16s, around 60 French-built Mirage 2000s and about 130 Ching-kuo Indigenous Defense Fighters, though the defense ministry will not give exact numbers. Taiwan has asked the United States for an additional 66 F-16s.
Training is the air force's strong suit, but experts say that a well-planned early Chinese missile strike could take out most Taiwan air base runways and render the island's aircraft, hidden in fortified or mountain bunkers, trapped on the ground.
- Once limited to just protecting China's coast, the Chinese navy has developed in leaps and bounds. Last year, Chinese warships began conducting anti-piracy missions in the sea around Somalia. China has a large and expanding submarine fleet, and has been looking at building an aircraft carrier.
- Taiwan's navy includes four submarines, two of which date from World War Two, and a small fleet of destroyers and frigates. The Defense Ministry will likewise not give exact figures.
- Aside from the estimated 1,400 missiles that China is thought to have aimed at Taiwan, the Chinese navy is equipped with powerful Russian "Sunburn" anti-ship missiles, a weapon much feared by U.S. military strategists.
On Friday, Washington proposed to Congress a $6.4 billion sale of Patriot "Advanced Capability-3" missiles, Black Hawk utility transport helicopters and other items.
Although they do not tip the balance of power, the new weaponry would make Beijing "think twice" about any attack, a Taiwan defense official said.
Patriots, regarded as some of the best equipment in its class, are designed to hit missiles in mid-air. Friday's proposed sale would sell 114 more of them to Taiwan.
