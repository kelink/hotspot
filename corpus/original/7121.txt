(Reuters) - China has started slowly pulling in the reins on loans and liquidity to stave off inflationary pressures and prevent the world's third-largest economy from overheating.
The moves have rattled financial markets as China's economy has largely led a global recovery in face of persistently weak demand in Western countries, though economists say the steps so far will do little to curb its insatiable demand for commodities and other imported goods.
China's economy grew at its fastest quarterly rate in two years in the fourth quarter while inflation accelerated, setting the stage for more policy tightening in coming months. Economists polled by Reuters see one to two interest rate hikes this year, with the first possibly before end-June.
Jan 21- China's central bank guides up its bill yields for the second time this year, highlighting its determination to fight inflationary pressures after the government reports the economy expanded 10.7 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter.
Jan 19 - China reaffirms it will maintain "reasonable growth" in credit and money supply, and stick with proactive policies to boost domestic demand, but will also curb speculative property investment and take steps to deal with inflationary expectations, Premier Wen Jiabao says.
Jan 18 - China's central bank allows one-year bill yields to rise more than expected, signaling in open market operations that its quantitative tightening was still intact but also that it aims to shift fund drains to longer-term tenors to rein in lending and fight inflation.
Jan 17 - China's banking regulator asks banks to be cautious on their lending strategies this year, ensuring credit is used in the real economy and not for speculation. It also calls on banks to monitor the property sector and make "greater efforts" to control their loan risks.
Jan 12 - China takes strongest steps yet toward tightening monetary policy, surprising investors with an earlier-than-expected increase in banks' required reserves that rocks global financial markets.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) also raises the yield on 20 billion yuan ($2.9 billion) in one-year bills after holding it steady in the previous 20 auctions, and drains a record 200 billion yuan from the financial system via 28-day bond repurchase agreements.
Jan 7 - China's central bank surprises market by raising the auction yield of its three-month bills for the first time since mid-August. The significant step-up in liquidity tightening sends offshore non-deliverable interest rate swaps (NDIRS) sharply higher.
Jan 4 - China's factories cranked up production in December on the back of bulging order books, but the strong demand also pushed prices higher and raised the specter of inflation, an HSBC manufacturing survey shows.
