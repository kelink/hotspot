PRECIOUS-Gold up 1 pct as China reveals huge reserves rise

(Reuters) - Gold rose 1 percent to a three-week high on Friday after China said its gold reserves had surged by nearly three-quarters since 2003, confirming years of speculation and raising hopes of more purchases to diversify its foreign exchange holdings.
A senior Chinese official was quoted as saying on Friday that Beijing had raised its gold reserves by 454 tonnes to a total 1,054 tonnes, the last time it revealed the figure. This makes it the fifth biggest country holder. [nPEK307477]
"They are increasing their gold holdings because they are worried about the dollar. I know if I held $2 trillion in U.S. Treasuries I'd want to hedge it," Peter McGuire, managing director at Commodity Warrants Australia, said.
With nearly $2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, and gold making up barely 1.6 percent of this, the scope for more Chinese buying is clear.
"They have a long way to go. Look at the size of their reserves. They should probably double it at least," said Jonathan Barratt, managing director of Commodity Broking Services.
Spot gold XAU= rose to $911.80 per ounce by 0639 GMT, up 1 percent from New York's notional close of $902.00. It has risen 5 percent so far this week, putting it on track for the biggest weekly gain for two months.
Prices have also been supported by physical demand from India, the world's largest consumer, ahead of the Akshaya Tritya festival on April 27, an auspicious time for gold buying.
Bullion's appeal as a safe-haven asset has been supported by persistent worries about the global economy and financial sector, with the market's focus now on the results of stress tests for U.S. banks due on May 4.
Holdings by the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, the SPDR Gold Trust XAUEXT-NYS-TT, fell to 1,104.45 tonnes as of April 23, down 1.53 tonnes or 0.1 percent from the previous day, extending a decline that began last week in the biggest unwinding of positions since September.

A 44 percent surge in SPDR's holdings since the start of the year had helped underpin gold prices, but the last increase was nearly a month ago.
With the market's mood fragile, key indicators like U.S. March durable goods orders and new home sales -- both due later in the day -- are being closely watched to gauge whether the recession is beginning to ease, which could trigger more gold selling as investors shift funds toward higher yielding assets.
