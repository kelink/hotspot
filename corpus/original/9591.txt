"We want to know what has happened, why it has happened and I will come back as soon as possible with proposals, if needed, to reinforce the instruments."
"It is very important in any case to start in 2011, the exit strategy. France and Germany have to be treated in the same fashion."
EUROGROUP'S JUNCKER
On upcoming visit to China by Juncker, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet and EU Economic Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia:
"It is foreseen that the three of us will travel to China. We'll discuss ... the exchange rate policy but I don't think it makes sense to indicate now what our message will be."
ECB'S TRICHET
"We very much share that view expressed by the Treasury secretary, and also share the views expressed by Ben Bernanke. The European Central Bank would echo this position, which has been recently repeated by the American authorities." "We don't put into question the seriousness of the secretary of the Treasury. We trust what they say."
EUROGROUP'S JUNCKER
"There are clear signs of recovery but there is still a balance between the positive sides and negative sides ... we don't think the time is right to put an end to our recovery programmes."
"We always say that we believe that the strength of a currency reflects the strength of the economy, so a strong euro reflects the strength of the European economy."
"We will discuss today what's going on in the economic forecasts for the next months. Now we will have a debate on what we discussed in Istanbul or in Gothenburg ... maybe we will discuss the euro, but it's not the main focus point this evening."
"It's clear that in the future, in the next months, we have to have a look at the euro compared to the U.S. dollar, compared to the Chinese currency, but it's not the main focus."
"We have to fight against the crisis. Also in these days and months, we have to prepare for the exit strategy. We will manage it in the next months and years. Those things are more important than the euro to the U.S. dollar or other currencies."
