UPDATE 2-Outokumpu lifts capacity as orders recover

(Reuters) - Finnish stainless steel maker Outokumpu (
) said on Thursday it would increase its production capacity due to a stronger order intake, but warned that underlying demand for stainless steel remained weak.
"In the past weeks Outokumpu's order intake for stainless steel has increased somewhat from the earlier very low levels," the firm said in a statement.
Outokumpu's share price erased earlier gains to fall 0.4 percent after the news, trading at 12.36 euros at 1314 GMT.
"The plan is however not to return to full production capacity at this stage," it said.
Outokumpu said inventories seemed to have been run down by distributors and end-users and that the increase in the nickel price had triggered some purchasing activity, but added it saw no signs of underlying demand for stainless steel picking up.
Delivery volumes in the third quarter would remain at depressed levels due to capacity constraints and maintenance shutdowns, it said.
"What is characteristic of the steel market is that when the prices go down, nobody wants to buy, but when they go up, it creates some demand," said FIM-analyst Michael Schroder.
Artem Beletski, analyst at Icecapital, said any real improvement in underlying demand would likely only be seen at the end of the year.
"The signs of recovery in the European stainless steel market will be reflected in the fourth-quarter results both for Outokumpu and its competitors," he added. (Editing by Jason Benham)
