(Reuters) - A Spanish court said on Tuesday it would free one of two suspected Somali pirates captured after the hijacking of a Spanish fishing boat because he appeared to be under 18-years-old.
The immediate future of the suspect, whose name was erased from the official court document announcing the decision because his age could be less than 18, will now be in the hands of Spain's juvenile justice system, which could send him to a juvenile correction centre.
The pirates are still in control of the boat, whose home port is in the Basque Country in northern Spain, have said they will not negotiate the crew's release until their two comrades are freed.
"Releasing only one of our friends will only worsen our relations with Spain," Hussein, an associate of the gang holding the ship, told Reuters by telephone from the pirate stronghold Haradheere.
Spain has tried to enlist the support of Somalia's government to obtain the liberation of the Alakrana.
China has said it was starting a rescue operation for a coal ship seized on Monday, leading to a threat on Tuesday from th pirates to kill the Chinese sailors onboard.
Despite patrols by foreign navies through shipping lanes linking Asia to Europe, pirates have continued to make millions of dollars by holding for ransom vessels caught in the waters off Somalia. (Reporting by Jason Webb; Editing by Angus MacSwan)
