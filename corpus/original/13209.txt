(Reuters) - Consumer prices in China are stabilizing after months of declines and could bottom out at the end of the third quarter before rebounding, the statistics department of the central bank said in a report on Tuesday.
It was the most explicit official statement yet pointing to the possibility of a return to inflation as China's economy recovery picks up steam.
"From an overall viewpoint, the consumer price index (CPI) will stabilize in the second half of this year and may rebound," the statistics department of the People's Bank of China said.
"Our composite index showed that CPI would hit bottom at the end of the third quarter," it said.
The consumer price index in China fell 1.7 percent in the year to June, its fifth straight month in mild deflationary territory.
"Global commodity markets have shown an overall trend of bottoming out and 'imported' inflationary pressure is likely to rise in the future," the central bank report said.
"Meanwhile, domestic demand is rising with continued sufficient liquidity, and inflationary expectations are emerging," it added.
The central bank also said China's growth recovery in the second quarter had been stronger than expected, at 14.9 percent on an annualized, seasonally-adjusted basis.
Despite sustained declines in consumer and producer prices, many economists and a growing number of officials have expressed concern about a fast rise in stock and property markets recently, powered by ample liquidity.
China's top leadership reaffirmed the country's "appropriately loose" monetary stance last week and Premier Wen Jiabao on Monday said policy would remain stable and consistent.
