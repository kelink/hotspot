UPDATE 2-China April iron ore imports at record; steel slumps

(Reuters) - China imported record amounts of iron ore in April and was also a net steel importer for the second month running, as the industry grappled with falling domestic ore output and slumping steel exports.
China imported a record 57 million tonnes of iron ore in April, an all-time high, up 9 percent from a month ago and 33 percent greater than last April, the General Administration of Customs said on Tuesday.
Customs data also showed China was a net importer of nearly 900,000 tonnes of crude steel, marking the second month running that inflows have exceeded outflows for the country, which had been a net steel exporter since 2005.
"All of them are surprising figures. The figures show that oversupply is very likely to worsen in May and June," said a senior trading executive in a state-owned steel mill, who asked not to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
"Domestic steel prices will not hold at the current level for a long time," he added.
Steel product imports, at 1.62 million tonnes, exceeded exports of 1.41 million tonnes, which were the lowest since October 2004.
"The volume of steel imports was similar to monthly levels in previous years, but we noticed that China imported more low-value-added steel products from eastern European mills this year, suggesting production costs there are much cheaper," said Du Wei, an analyst for consultancy, Umetal.com.
Record iron ore imports reflected slowing domestic output due to the high cost of production compared with mines in places like Australia, Brazil and India, and that hunger for foreign ore is also feeding into freight rates.
The Baltic Exchange's main sea freight index .BADI, which tracks rates to ship dry bulk commodities, was at 2,215 points on Tuesday, higher by 0.05 percent from a day ago, and near its highest for the year so far -- a peak of 2,298 points was hit in March. [ID:nLB720607].
"The massive imports reflected in the rising seaborne freight index in the past months, and that trend could continue in May and June as we do not expect a rapid fall in Chinese iron ore imports in the near future," Du said.
Indeed, Indian iron ore prices have risen in the past few days, lifted by Chinese buyers who are looking to save money on rising freight costs by booking material from nearby suppliers.
A large miner-cum-exporter in east India said deals were done on Friday for ores with 63.5 percent iron content at $66.5 and $67 with freight, up from $66.1 earlier last week. [ID:nBOM404836]
"Since Thursday, demand has increased," the exporter said.
Iron ore stockpiles at Chinese ports edged up only 2 million tonnes in April, according to data from Chinica Shipbrokers Ltd [ID:nSHA48456], implying that about 55 million tonnes of imported ore found its way to mills and markets in April.
"This means China's demand for imported iron ore is solid and sustainable. I expect China's iron ore imports this year could rise from last year," said analyst Henry Liu at Macquarie Bank.
"It seems that talks about imported ore substituting domestic-produced are real," he said.
Those 55 million tonnes of high-grade imported iron ore translate into pig iron production of around 34 million tonnes, or more than 80 percent of expected average monthly production of around 42 million tonnes in China.

Chinese steelmakers have been pushing for a 40 percent price cut in this year's talks and an industry group executive told Reuters Chinese steel mills were not able to afford high ore prices due to their weak profits.
