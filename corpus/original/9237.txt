) has proposed an alternative nuclear fuel recycling system, which could reduce radioactive waste and avoid extraction of plutonium that can be used for making weapons.
Nuclear experts say while the proposed Advanced Recycling Center (ARC) could help to solve some of the biggest worries as more countries build nuclear reactors, high costs are drawbacks.
-- What happens to spent nuclear fuel?
-- What happens in countries that have opted to recycle spent nuclear fuels?
Uranium accounts for about 95 percent of the volume, while plutonium is about 1 percent and about 3 percent is fission products or nuclear waste.
Uranium can be re-enriched and used as fuel in nuclear reactors. At present, it is stored in most countries. France has reactors that can use such fuel after it is re-enriched in Russia. Plutonium is processed into mixed oxide fuel, or MOX, for use in reactors.
-- Which countries have opted for the closed fuel cycle or to reprocess spent nuclear fuel?
China, France, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia and Britain. The United States is reconsidering its policy and could in future treat spent nuclear fuels.
-- Where are such reprocessing capacity?
Major facilities include those in La Hague in France, Sellafield in Britain, Ozersk in Russia, and Rokkasho in Japan. (Source: World Nuclear Association) (Reporting by Nao Nakanishi; editing by James Jukwey)
