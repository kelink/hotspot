FACTBOX: What is the Non-Proliferation Treaty?
Mon  EDT
Last month, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and U.S. President Barack Obama agreed to pursue a new arms deal, in accordance with U.S. and Russian obligations in the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
-- The objective of the treaty, which took effect in 1970, is to halt the spread of nuclear weapons-making capability, guarantee the right of all members to develop nuclear energy for peaceful ends and -- for the original five nuclear weapons powers -- to phase out their arsenals.
-- The treaty defines nuclear-armed states as those that "manufactured and exploded a nuclear weapon or other nuclear device prior to January 1, 1967." They are the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia (which assumed rights and obligations from the Soviet Union). The five are the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
-- Two non-signatories, India and Pakistan, developed nuclear arsenals and another, Israel, is widely assumed to have one but has never confirmed it publicly.
-- U.S. President Barack Obama said North Korea, which tested a nuclear device in 2006, had violated U.N. resolutions with what analysts believe was effectively a test of a ballistic missile in April.
-- Non-nuclear signatories must not develop or acquire such weapons but are given an assurance of assistance in developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, monitored by inspectors from the Vienna-based IAEA.
-- The treaty is divided into 11 articles, including one that enables a state to withdraw "if it decides that extraordinary events ... have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country." A state must give three months' notice to other treaty parties and the U.N. Security Council.
-- At the 1995 review conference, the treaty was extended indefinitely at the behest of nuclear weapons powers. Developing countries agreed to the extension after a commitment from weapons states to step up disarmament, ease access to nuclear energy for development and seek a nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle East. They say these pledges have not been fully honored.
