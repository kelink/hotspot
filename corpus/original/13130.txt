The world's second-biggest steelmaker, which competes with China's Baosteel (
), Japan's JFE Holdings Inc (
) and South Korea's POSCO (
), said its recurring loss, which is before tax and special items, for April-June was 56.7 billion yen ($601 million), compared to a profit of 144.1 billion yen a year earlier.
But the company kept its forecast to break-even on a recurring basis for the year to March 2010, which is roughly in line with a market consensus estimate of a 3.38 billion yen loss from 17 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.
Japanese blast furnace makers appear to have overcome the worst of the global economic slowdown. Orders and production are rising helped by a recovery in demand for exports and cars, where the contraction in orders had been most severe.
Nippon Steel plans to restart its biggest blast furnace in southern Japan next month, though it remains cautious regarding the demand outlook in the second half.
Shares in Nippon Steel have risen 33 percent this year, compared to JFE's 58 percent jump and POSCO's 24 percent rise. (Reporting by Yuko Inoue; Editing by Dhara Ranasinghe)
