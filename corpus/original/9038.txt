METALS-Copper settles lower on weak U.S. confidence data

(Reuters) - Copper succumbed to currency related liquidation pressures on Tuesday, after weak U.S. consumer confidence bolstered the greenback's safe haven appeal and cast doubts over the pace of economic recovery.
Copper for December delivery HGZ9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division shed 1.20 cents to settle at $2.9990 a lb, after dealing between $2.9440 and $3.0290.
"I think it's mostly from this two-day strong bounce in the dollar," said Matthew Zeman, head of trading with LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago. "The consumer confidence numbers were not good. Copper looks like it's starting to waver around this $3 mark."
On the London Metal Exchange (LME), copper for three-month delivery MCU3 ended down $28 at $6,585 a tonne. On Monday, the metal used in power and construction touched a 13-month high of $6,732.
The Conference Board's U.S. consumer confidence index fell to 47.7 this month from 53.4 in September, its weakest since July and well below forecasts for a reading of 53.1. For story, see [ID:nN27236301]
"Everything has been eclipsed by the consumer confidence data," said Peter Fertig, analyst at Quantitative Commodity Research.
DEMAND TO EASE?

"The rate of (Chinese) buying seems likely to slow now into the year end and with restocking elsewhere remaining lackluster the line of least resistance for the short term would appear to be to the downside," RBC Capital Markets said in a note.
Elsewhere, investors were eyeing LME stocks, which continue to rise, indicating demand has yet to recover outside China. The latest data showed stocks rose 1,800 tonnes to total 370,650 -- their highest level since mid-May. <LME/STX1>
