China launches gas safety campaign in small mines

(Reuters) - China said it has launched a safety campaign to address the hidden danger of methane gas in small coal mines, which produce about a third of the country's coal, the country's top economic planner said on Tuesday.
Ninety percent of China's coal mines have annual production capacity below 300,000 tonnes, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said on its website (www.ndrc.gov.cn).
Explosions from gas built up in coal mines are a major safety threat to China's coal industry.
Small mines that do not meet safety standards for methane gas treatment by the time the campaign ends in September 2010, will be shut down, the statement said.
China, the world's largest coal producer and consumer, has said it plans to reduce the number of small mines to less than 10,000 by October 2010. China had more than 14,000 small mines as of last October.
China will boost power-generating capacity from plants burning coal-bed methane by 63 percent to 1.5 gigawatts by 2010 from last year, the NDRC said earlier this week. [ID:nPEK6041] (Reporting by Rujun Shen and Jacqueline Wong)
