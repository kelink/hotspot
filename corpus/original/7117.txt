Single, bitter? Chinese government helps lovebirds
Thu  EST
(Reuters Life!) - China's central government has set up a match-making website to help thousands of busy but lonely government workers find love at work.
"Are you still single and bitter?" asks the pink-themed website (www.ywqq.gov.cn).
"Members have high caliber, are well-educated and have stable jobs," it says.
"All information has been confirmed by the labor union at their respective employer, and registered with the Ministry of Public Security, to assure accuracy and reliability."
Magpie Bridge has so far attracted more than 5,000 civil servants from the central government and the Beijing municipal government since it was established in 2005.
The website aims at providing a "pure and safe environment," different from commercial matchmaking sites which are notorious in China for being filled with fake personal information.
It doesn't list a success rate but, at 100 yuan ($14.65) for a year's subscription for a civil servant, it seems a bargain.
