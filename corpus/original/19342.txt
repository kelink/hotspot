(Reuters) - The Korea Exchange (KRX) expects 10 foreign companies, including 4 or 5 Chinese firms, to go public in Seoul this year, an executive said on Tuesday, adding it was also trying to win IPOs from companies in Southeast Asia.
As of end-March, 21 foreign companies had mandated domestic brokerages to list on the South Korean bourse, including four U.S. firms, one German and one Vietnamese company, Kwang-soo Lee, President of KRX's KOSPI Market Division, told the Reuters Global Financial Regulation Summit in Seoul.
"We will have no problem to make it to 10 this year," he said, referring to the expected number of foreign companies' initial public offerings in the country this year.
"Up to now, we had been focused on China, but we will diversify into Southeast Asia and the United States to attract more IPOs."
Lee added Korindo Group of Indonesia and Kolao Group of Laos were interested in making trade debuts in South Korea. Both companies, headed by South Korean businessmen, have not made public share offerings.
Six companies, including China's textile company Huafeng Group (
), are traded in South Korean stock markets.
South Korea is also revising laws to introduce a variety of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), based on bonds, currency, gold and other products, on top of the existing stock ETFs.
