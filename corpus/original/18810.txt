(Reuters) - More than 40 percent of Chinese dams and reservoirs are at risk of breaching this flood season which could be worse than normal, state media quoted the country's water resources minister as saying.
Heavy rain is expected to hit the Yangtze and Huaihe Rivers in central China, while floods and typhoons could be worse due to climate change, Minister of Water Resources Chen Lei was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua news agency.
"Extreme weather may pose a big threat to dam safety," Chen said. "Special purpose inspections on dams also show many of them are not in good condition. Dam safety is in a severe situation."
Xinhua said China had more dams and reservoirs than any other country, 59 of which breached between 1999 and 2008, 30 due to torrential rain and 20 caused by quality problems.
Chen said about 37,000 reservoirs, or 43 percent of China's total, were at risk, but only 3,642 dams were undergoing repairs.
Few dams had early warning systems, he added.
Chairman Mao Zedong, who died in 1976, ordered the country to develop at any cost, putting special emphasis on large-scale projects such as steelworks and dams.
But many projects were hastily and poorly built, with little regard for the environment.
In 1975, tens of thousands of residents of Henan province in central China died after two dams collapsed. That disaster was revealed to the public only in recent years. (Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Nick Macfie)
