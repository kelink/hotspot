TREASURIES-Bonds choppy in stock-data tussle

(Reuters) - U.S. government bonds were little changed on Monday after markets shrugged off global equity losses and focused on data expected to signal economic recovery.
This increased demand overnight for Treasuries, which investors prefer during times of financial uncertainty, but the market struggled to stay in positive territory after closing out a three-week rally on Friday.
The market was also awaiting a slew of data this week, including the 9:45 a.m. Chicago PMI report on business activity in the U.S. Midwest. Investors will also be bracing for Thursday's announcement of next week's bond auctions.
"There is some overnight profit-taking. The market is up and people are trying to get in front of the supply next week," said Thomas di Galoma, head of fixed income rates trading at Guggenheim Capital Markets LLC, a New York based brokerage firm for institutional investors.
The benchmark 10-year note US10YT=RR were unchanged in price, yielding 3.45 percent. Yields earlier fell to 3.40 percent, their lowest since August 21.
This week's economic indicators will culminate in Friday's employment report.
Other releases include the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing report on Tuesday and Wednesday's release of the minutes of the Aug 11-12 Federal Reserve policy meeting.
