FACTBOX: How China and Taiwan square off militarily

(Reuters) - The military balance between China and Taiwan is rapidly shifting in China's favor.
Despite improved political ties following the election in Taiwan of a more pro-China president last year, China has yet to renounce the use of force to recover the self-ruled island it considers sovereign territory.
Following is a brief comparison between China's and Taiwan's military forces:
Personnel 2.3 million* 277,765
- China's 2.3 million-strong armed forces are far bigger than the world's second-largest military, that of the United States, whose forces number around 1.5 million. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) was born out of the Red Army, a five-million-strong peasant army, which swept the Communists to power in 1949.
Soviet expertise helped organize it into a mass army geared toward wars of attrition during the 1950s, when it fought in the 1950-1953 Korean War alongside North Korea. The PLA is morphing into a modern force capable of fighting short, high-intensity conflicts against high-tech adversaries.
- With U.S. military aid, Taiwan transformed its army from the defeated remnants of the Nationalist forces which fled to the island in 1949 into a modern, disciplined military that is now downsizing in favor of improved technology.
Fighter aircraft more than 2,000 about 400
- China used to rely on somewhat substandard copies of Soviet-made aircraft, but these days has developed a more formidable design capacity. Its most advanced aircraft, and for Taiwan the potentially most threatening, are Russian Su-30 and Su-27 fighters.
- The backbone of Taiwan's air force is made up of U.S.-made F-16s, around 60 French-built Mirage 2000s and about 130 Ching-kuo Indigenous Defense Fighters, though the defense ministry will not give exact numbers.
Training is the air force's strong suit, but experts say that a well-planned early Chinese missile strike could take out most Taiwan air base runways and render the island's aircraft, hidden in fortified or mountain bunkers, trapped on the ground.
- Once limited to just protecting China's coast, the Chinese navy has developed in leaps and bounds. Last year, Chinese warships began conducting anti-piracy missions in the sea around Somalia. China has a large and expanding submarine fleet, and has been looking at building an aircraft carrier.
- Taiwan's navy includes four submarines, two of which date from World War Two, and a small fleet of destroyers and frigates. The Defense Ministry will likewise not give exact figures.
- Aside from the estimated 1,000 to 1,500 missiles that China is thought to have aimed at Taiwan, the Chinese navy is equipped with powerful Russian "Sunburn" anti-ship missiles, a weapon much feared by U.S. military strategists.
* Does not include about one million Chinese reserves and about 800,000 paramilitary People's Armed Police.
