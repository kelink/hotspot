Geithner to stop in Europe for talks on crisis

(Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will make stops in Britain and Germany next week to discuss troubled economic conditions there en route home from China, the Treasury Department said on Thursday night.
The U.S. Treasury said Geithner will meet Britain's new Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, in London next Wednesday. He then travels to Germany for meetings with European Central bank President Jean-Claude Trichet in Frankfurt and German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble in Berlin on Thursday.
Concern has been rising that Europe lacks enough unity to come up with a package of measures to restore stability to the region, especially after Germany decided on its own earlier this week to ban some types of short selling to try to curb speculation.
That led to a clash between France and Germany, co-founders of the euro, that spooked markets on Wednesday and sent the currency to a four-year low beneath $1.22 U.S.
U.S. stocks sank nearly 4 percent on Thursday on fears the euro zone's efforts to tackle its sovereign debt crisis might fall short and jeopardize the global economic recovery.
"Absolutely Europe has the capacity to manage through this. We just want to see them follow through," he said on Wednesday.
