(Reuters) - Chinese solar power company Yingli Green Energy reported an unexpected quarterly loss and cut its forecast for full-year sales, sending its shares down 9 percent.
The company also said its margins would widen as prices for solar products bottomed out, but irked investors by providing few specifics on pricing.
"We believe the first quarter marked a low point for the whole industry this year, Yingli Green Energy included," Chief Executive Liansheng Miao told a conference call.
The Baoding, China-based company posted a loss of $20.7 million, or 16 cents per American depositary receipt, compared with a year-earlier profit of $31.9 million, or 25 cents per share.
Analysts, on average, had forecast a profit of 1 cent per share, according Reuters Estimates.
The company said it expected to ship 450 to 500 megawatts of solar modules, down from the 550 to 600 MW it had forecast in February.
Like other solar makers, Yingli said it would see further declines in the average selling prices (ASPs) for solar products in the second quarter, but prices would be flat in the third quarter. Still, the company did not give specifics on pricing, causing concern for at least one analyst.
"While expanded gross margins are certainly promising as they reflect (Yingli's) ability to drive down its blended polysilicon costs, we are acutely concerned with the increasing lack of disclosure surrounding ASPs and volumes," Simmons & Co analyst Burt Chao said in a note to clients.
Shares of Yingli, which had surged 65 percent so far this year, fell 71 cents, or 7 percent, at $9.40 at mid-afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.
