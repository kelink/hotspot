2009-04-24 04:28:00.0
(Reuters) - The euro rose against the dollar on Friday as a key survey of German business confidence gave evidence of a tentative improvement in the euro zone economy.
The closely watched German Ifo survey's business climate index rose to 83.7 in April from 82.2 in March, beating forecasts for 82.3, while current conditions and expectations also rose [ID:nBAE001643].
The euro rose to a session high after the data, which followed earlier news that French consumer spending also rose much more than forecast [ID:nLO178312].
Market players were also awaiting developments at the meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington as they discuss the global economic crisis, but no major market-moving developments are expected [ID:nN20404494].
"The yen has gained on short covering ahead of the weekend, given the uncertainty over General Motors and Chrysler and about the U.S. stress tests, and also because the yen is the currency that has been most sold recently," Frankfurt-based currency analyst at Commerzbank Antje Praefcke said.
She added that the euro has benefitted from the recent signs of stabilisation in economic data, but any gains are likely to be capped due to the number of uncertainties in the market.
At 0813 GMT, the euro jumped by 0.6 percent against the dollar to $1.3226
, having hit a session high of $1.3237.
, just above an earlier low of 96.65 yen hit on trading system EBS, its lowest since March 30.
Traders said some of the dollar's losses came as China announced a rise in its gold reserves, although it has said it will stick to major currencies and high-quality assets as it diversified its foreign exchange reserves. [ID:nPEK307477] [nBJC000313]
Takahide Nagasaki, chief FX strategist for Daiwa Securities SMBC in Tokyo, said any diversification was unlikely to take place quickly.
"I doubt that China will immediately sell the dollar or U.S. Treasuries," Nagasaki said, adding that any sudden shift would only work against China, which has large holdings of U.S. debt.
Elsewhere, sterling was weak, falling by 0.5 percent to $1.4638 against the dollar
, while the euro rose by 1.2 percent to 90.33 pence EURGBP=.
Traders noted an article in the UK's Daily Telegraph flagging risks to Britain's sovereign credit rating was weighing on the UK currency. Friday's UK gross domestic product data for the first quarter will also be eyed closely.
