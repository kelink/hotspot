(Reuters) - Shares in China sank 2.9 percent on Friday, taking Hong Kong stocks down with them, led by banks after reports that August lending in China may drop sharply, trimming liquidity flowing into the market.

Chinese banks have lent around 200 billion yuan ($29 billion) so far this month, with the four biggest state-owned banks lending around 100 billion yuan, bankers said.
If lending in August continues at this level, it will lag far behind the 360 billion yuan reported in July and a monthly average of more than 1 trillion yuan recorded for the first six months of this year.
"The market had expected lending to fall in August but not so sharply," said senior economist He Zhicheng at Agricultural Bank of China in Beijing.

"The index may test its 125-day moving average (now at 2,750 points) as it appears to need to seek a fresh floor," said Tang Yonggang, chief strategist at Hongyuan Securities in Beijing. He added that the market's consolidation period might last longer than previously expected.
But many other analysts still believed that the index would generally move in a narrow range between 2,800 and 3,000 points in the near term, reasoning that the slump this month had washed out most of the profit-taking pressure accumulated during the market's 90-percent surge earlier this year.
The market was also weighed down recently by a series of announcements of new share supplies, including a $1.6 billion additional offer by second-biggest property developer China Vanke (
