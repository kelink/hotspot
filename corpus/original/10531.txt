(Reuters Life!) - A fashion website is allowing men to turn designers by customizing their own shirts.
The site www.ShirtsMyWay.com says it offers seven trillion different shirt designs, with users picking what type of sleeves, collar, buttons and other detailing they want on an interactive model.
Co-founders Peter Crawfurd and Michael Yang launched the site in February, saying they wanted to differentiate themselves from online tailors by focusing on the design aspect. The company is based and makes the shirts in China.
"We see the shirt as a canvas where you just can put anything that you want on it," Yang told Reuters by telephone.
"You have a lot of flexibility, you get to be creative with it," Crawfurd said.
The co-founders say word-of-mouth has helped them spread their customer base. At the moment, more than 80 percent of their sales are to the United States. Norway comes in second.
"We would like to see an expansion into women's clothing as well in the future," Yang said.
