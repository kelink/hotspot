(Reuters) - Brazilian pulp producer Aracruz ARCZ6.SAARA.N posted a first-quarter loss on Thursday, citing a surge in shipping costs and the price of timber.
The net loss totaled 1.7 million reais ($800,000), compared with year-earlier profit of 168 million reais, Aracruz said in a securities filing. The company had massive losses of 2.98 billion reais in the fourth quarter because of wrong-way bets on currency derivatives.
The company's total debt, including obligations from its 50 percent stake in subsidiary Veracel, rose to 9.5 billion reais at the end of March from 3 billion reais a year earlier.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a key measure of cash flow known as EBITDA, fell 32 percent to 247.4 million reais.
Net revenue in the quarter totaled 853.5 million reais, compared with 841.4 million reais a year earlier, hurt by lower net pulp prices.
"The effects of the global financial crisis has continued to negatively impact the pulp and paper sector, with prices falling in all regions," Aracruz said in the filing.
"Global market pulp shipments showed a 9 percent drop in demand (compared with the first quarter of 2008), despite a record increase in shipments to China, which were up by 64 percent for the period," it said.
The company said selling expenses, which included shipping costs and the price of timber, jumped 29 percent to 745.52 million reais.
Aracruz was one of several Brazilian companies reporting huge foreign exchange losses late last year after the country's currency plunged against the U.S. dollar.
After the currency surged 20 percent against the dollar in 2007 and 14 percent in 2008 through early August, many companies bet it would stay on a strong path.
But those bets turned sour as the global financial crisis deepened, causing a sharp capital outflow from emerging markets and prompting the real to weaken.
