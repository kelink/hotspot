The petite 24-year-old Russian surged ahead after only six kilometers, staging a sparkling one-woman show, with a time of 1:28:10, that left the competition scrambling for the other medals.
Ireland's Olive Loughnane bravely held on for silver 49 seconds later, just ahead of China's Liu Hong.
Kaniskina's win means Russian women have won the last five 20km walk golds at the world championships.
Russia enjoyed double success in the category in Berlin after Olympic champion Valeriy Borchin took the men's gold on Saturday.
On a hot and humid day, the walkers started at the iconic Brandenburg Gate, racing down a tree-lined loop along the Unter den Linden boulevard.
Kaniskina upped the pace after 5km, moving top of the pack that was briefly led by Germany's Sabine Krantz who was later disqualified.
Joined by fellow Russian Anisya Kirdyapkina and Olympic silver medallist Kjersti Plaetzer, the trio soon broke away, looking to divide the three medals among themselves.
With tens of thousands of fans cheering her on in downtown Berlin, the Russian finished at the Brandenburg Gate, a big smile of relief on her face.
