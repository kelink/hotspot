(Reuters) - Costs are mounting for pork producers as some countries, concerned about the global spread of a new strain of swine flu, ban U.S., Canadian and Mexican pork, industry groups said on Thursday.
The bans have cut U.S. pork exports by 8 to 12 percent and slowed buying from Mexico, an official from the U.S. Meat Export Federation said on Wednesday.
Based on 2008 numbers, the ban on pork products will cost the U.S. pork industry $710 million annually, or roughly $13.6 million per week, if trade in pork is not restored, the American Meat Institute estimated.
Several countries have banned Mexican pork and swine exports, but Mexico is a net pork importer, and its pork exports go mainly to Japan and South Korea, which have not restricted meat imports.
