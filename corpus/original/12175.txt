Wumart will also issue 41.52 million domestic shares to Hony Capital and 8.48 million domestic shares to Lenovo-affiliated Legend Holdings Ltd for 485 million yuan ($71 million), including an arrangement fee.
Wumart, which has a retail network of 424 stores comprising 107 superstores and 317 mini-marts, said the shares are subject to a 12 month lock-up period, and it would use the funds for store expansion and acquisitions.
