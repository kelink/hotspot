The sixth entry in the fantasy series earned $42.7 million from 64 markets, taking its international haul to $492.3 million and its worldwide total to $747.7 million.
Top markets include the U.K. ($66.5 million), Japan ($50.8 million), Germany ($48.2 million) and France ($40.3 million).
New domestic champ "Funny People" opened in Russia to an estimated $500,000. Russia also hosted the international debut of another new title, the family comedy "Aliens in the Attic," which scared up $467,000 (as well as $16,000 in the Caribbean).
The weekend's No. 2 title was "Up," which opened in seven territories. Combined with holdovers it generated $23.7 million from a total of 23 markets. A No. 1 France debut kicked in $9.1 million, while Spain opened with $8.6 million -- the market's biggest opening of 2009.
"Up's" overseas rollout, which began May 31, is a marathon not a sprint, Disney said. The overseas run concludes December 5 in Japan. The foreign total currently stands at $80.2 million with China and Singapore opening this week.
Third was "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," which elicited $22.3 million from 68 markets. After five rounds overseas, the Ice Age threequel has drawn a total of $549.7 million, making it the foreign circuit's highest-grossing animation title of all time. The previous record-holder was Disney's "Finding Nemo," which generated $525 million in 2003.
The Sandra Bullock comedy "The Proposal" was No. 4 after expanding its run to at least a half-dozen new markets, drawing $11 million overall from 32 territories and hoisting its overseas total to $78.2 million.
Finishing fifth was Disney's big-budget "G-Force," which spread its 3D animated wings in 14 new markets in its second weekend. It grossed $10.9 million overall from 15 territories, including a No. 2 start in Britain with $4.5 million. The international total stands at $11.4 million.
