China shares drop to 4-wk low; HK stocks follow suit
2009-08-12 12:16:00.0
(Reuters) - Chinese stocks sank to a four-week low on Wednesday morning on broad-based selling as worries deepened about a possible tightening of market liquidity after a sharp drop in bank lending in July.
Hong Kong shares followed suit, with overnight losses on Wall Street and the slide in Shanghai stocks, giving investors the excuse they needed to take profit on the recent rally that took the main index to a near 12-month high.
"The rally in the (Shanghai) index has far exceeded the speed of economic recovery," said Western Securities analyst Cao Xuefeng. "Yesterday's mixed economic data and sharp drop in bank lending heightened such worries, while weak overseas markets triggered the sell-off."
China's central bank said on Tuesday that banks extended 355.9 billion yuan ($52.08 billion) in new local-currency loans in July, down from 1.53 trillion yuan in June and a sharper fall than many analysts had forecast, although the second half had been widely expected to see a marked slowdown in lending.
