) is "very confident" it will be able to deliver returns on equity of between 15 percent and 19 percent, despite banks needing to hold more capital, its finance director said on Tuesday. Douglas Flint said on a webcast of a speech delivered in New York that higher margins should ensure it can achieve its long-term returns, despite the restructuring of the global regulatory framework and shifts in business mix.
"The repricing that's going through the asset side of the balance sheet and the geographic distribution we have makes us very confident that the returns that we targeted a couple of years ago remain appropriate with the capital ratios we have now set ourselves," Flint said.
Margins on business also made it harder to justify potential acquisitions, he said.
"The spreads on organic new business are such that the hurdle rates for acquisition are higher than they've ever been," Flint said.
He said the bank will continue to target investment on emerging markets and said HSBC's position in China, for example, had significantly improved as rivals have cut their stakes in Chinese banks or reduced investment as they have pulled back to their home markets.
"That will significantly impact their ability to do business in China over decades. That (staying in China) is a large feather in our cap relative to the competition," he said. (Reporting by Steve Slater; Editing by Greg Mahlich)
