(Reuters) - Aurubis (
), Europe's biggest copper smelter, said on Wednesday it expected its production facilities to remain fully utilised as it reported a second-quarter pretax profit that beat expectations.
The company posted a pretax profit of 65 million euros ($88.60 million) in the quarter to March, better than the average estimate of 35 million in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Aurubis said its second-quarter results benefited greatly from rising copper prices, which sharply increased the value of its inventories, but that it was still suffering from a weak demand for copper products.

Aurubis, formerly Norddeutsche Affinerie, said its earnings were expected to improve slowly during the course of its fiscal year to September and kept its forecast for a positive operating result.
Aurubis shares were down 3.17 percent at 21.96 euros by 1027 GMT, while the German mid-cap index .MDAXI was down 0.24 percent.
The company said its processing of copper concentrate in the first half rose sharply to 1,043,000 tonnes from 631,000 tonnes the previous year.
It produced 443,000 tonnes of copper cathodes -- new metal -- from concentrate against 225,000 tonnes in the prior year.
The company produced 102,000 tonnes of cathodes from scrap versus 100,000 the previous year.
The company said it faced intense competition from Chinese scrap buyers, who were able to offer higher prices for old metal because Chinese internal copper prices were higher than in the rest of the world, and predicted that the scrap market would stay volatile for the next few months.
"Competitors in China were extremely active in the procurement of materials in the international raw materials markets," Aurubis said.
Copper concentrate treatment and refining charge (TC/RC), fees paid by mines and other concentrate owners to copper smelters to refine ore into metal, a key part of earnings, were also under pressure.
Chinese copper smelters were able to accept lower TC/RCs and still make profits because of the higher domestic copper prices, the company said. ($1=.7336 Euro) (Editing by Karen Foster)
