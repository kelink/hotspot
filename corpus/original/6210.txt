Snap Analysis: China yuan move may disappoint on near-term rise

(Reuters) - China's announcement on Saturday to make the yuan more flexible is largely a goodwill gesture, one that will likely lead to more volatility in daily trading but does not pave the way for sharp appreciation in the near term.
While short-term dollar/yuan offshore forwards may overreact to the statement and price in sharp appreciation, market players may not yet realize how much Beijing could allow the yuan to rise on a six-month to two-year horizon.
Saturday's statement, just before the coming Group of 20 meeting, showed that Beijing was ready to break the nearly two-year-old dollar peg but had ruled out an immediate revaluation, as offshore market players have been speculating on for much of the year.
Spot yuan will now be more volatile, compared with movements of just one or two pips a day since July 2008 when China repegged the yuan to the dollar to soften the impact of the global financial crisis on the economy.
Chinese stocks will likely gain and bond yields fall because a shift on currency policy typically signals that the People's Bank of China will not immediately raise interest rates.
* The PBOC will now use the yuan's daily mid-point -- the reference rate against which the yuan can rise or fall 0.5 percent against the dollar -- to allow the yuan to stage what mainland dealers have called "mini-revaluations via the market" in the medium term.
* Initial movements will not be big, possibly about 5-50 pips a day against the PBOC mid-point and in line with the dollar's movements in global markets.
* In the first three months, yuan appreciation is not likely to exceed 2 percent, to around 6.7 against the dollar from Friday's close of 6.8262. For a graphic on historic yuan rates:
* But as China is expected to enjoy robust productivity growth compared and maintain hefty trade surpluses with major trading partners, the yuan will eventually appreciate against the dollar and the currencies of those trade partners.
* Cumulatively, the yuan can be expected to appreciate 3 percent in about six months and 5 to 6 percent in a year, in line with the progress of China's economic growth.
* Dollar/yuan non-deliverable forwards will almost certainly see frantic speculation in the short end of the curve on Monday, up to three months, as offshore players typically underestimate China's determination to be gradual with any major reforms.
* By contrast, investors in the middle of the NDF curve -- between six months and two years -- should have sufficient reason to short dollars more aggressively.
* One-year NDFs now imply yuan appreciation of only around 2 percent, lagging far behind how much China may actually allow the yuan to appreciate over that period. Yuan implied volatility may also get a boost.
* After the yuan has surged about 15 percent against the euro this year, China is likely to engineer depreciation against the euro to offset any rise versus the dollar.
* The Chinese stock market's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index could rise around 2 percent on Monday as investors are likely to buy large-cap shares such as airlines, banks and property, whose assets will be boosted by yuan appreciation in the long term.
* The share index may still not be able to break out of the narrow trading range between 2,500 and 2,600 points that has confined it since the start of this month, as market sentiment is weak due to government steps to cool the property market and worries about the impact of the euro zone crisis on exports.
* The middle of China's government bond yield curve is expected to fall several basis points as the move on yuan reform means China is unlikely to raise interest rates immediately.
* The authorities typically keep interest rates stable during currency reforms to deter speculators, fearing that foreign investors would pour funds into Shanghai if the yuan were appreciating at the same time as interest rates were climbing relative to those of major trade partners.
* On the money market, the benchmark seven-day bond repurchase rate, should see no direct impact from the yuan announcement but will rise further, with liquidity drying up in the run-up to a major initial public offering by Agricultural Bank of China.
