) is talking to potential acquisition targets in China, India and Brazil as the audio products company plans to spend up to $200 million in deals over the next 12 to 18 months, its chief executive said.
The acquisitions will be part of a larger strategy for the company, whose brands include Harman Kardon, JBL, Mark Levinson and Infinity, to rapidly expand its business in these countries.
Harman is targeting revenue of about $1.4 billion from China, India and Brazil by 2015, compared with an estimated $175 million in fiscal 2010. The company's overall revenue for the fiscal year ended June 2009 was $2.89 billion.
"We are looking at all three countries right now. And there are excellent targets," CEO Dinesh Paliwal said in an interview with Reuters.
"We are in the midst of making those moves," he added.
The company plans to double its revenue in China this year to about $200 million, he said.

Founded by Sidney Harman in 1953 as Harman Kardon, Stamford, Connecticut-based Harman International went on to create the world's first stereo receiver and the first high-frequency loudspeakers for professional recording studios.
Shares of Harman, which have tripled in the last 52 weeks, were trading up 22 cents at $44.18 in morning trade Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
