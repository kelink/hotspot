(Reuters) - China might extend through 2020 its goal of improving energy efficiency, the official China Daily reported on Friday, citing sources involved in a government discussion.
Now that goal of cutting energy intensity -- or energy consumption used in generating each dollar of gross domestic product -- could be extended for another decade, according to a source close to the country's climate change office.
"I was told that between 2011-20, China will probably promise to achieve the same energy-saving target as it is doing during the 2006-10 period," the source, who was invited to an internal meeting held by National Development and Reform Commission, told the China Daily.
China's energy intensity in the first quarter of this year fell 2.89 percent from a year earlier, compared with a 4.59 percent decline in energy use per unit of GDP for the whole of 2008.
