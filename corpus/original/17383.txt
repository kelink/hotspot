Both companies had improved their offers over the weekend in response to German government demands. Magna's founder Frank Stronach said on Thursday his company had significantly increased the amount of its own capital it was offering for Opel.
"If Opel is to survive, the contest to choose the correct partner for the company must not descend to a simple contest of political point-scoring and job preservation at all costs," said IHS Global Insight analyst Tim Urquhart.
A fourth bidder, China's Beijing Automotive Industry Corp (BAIC), could still be in the running if it comes up with a more detailed offer.
To tide Opel over, Germany has put together a 1.5 billion euro ($2.1 billion) aid package. But it has made this aid contingent on the U.S. government and GM agreeing to its plan to temporarily place Opel assets in a trust, a move that would protect its patents and technology from GM creditors.
An alternative to the trustee model would be an insolvency filing, which the German government has said remains an option.
Under an insolvency filing, Opel would be placed under administration and restructured. Parts of the company could be sold to raise cash, but GM Europe has said that Opel's liquidity would last into the third quarter.
Under German regulations, companies file for insolvency if they have more debt than assets, if they are unable to meet their payment obligations, or if it is likely they will become unable to meet their obligations.
German law also allows creating an insolvency plan in which the debtor and its creditors agree on settlement of claims and the debtor's liability after the insolvency proceedings end.
It is unclear how much debt Opel has, but the Financial Times earlier cited an offer document sent to the Opel bidders by GM as saying that Opel and sister brand Vauxhall would post a $3 billion loss before interest and tax this year.
