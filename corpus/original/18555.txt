(Reuters) - Global stocks and oil prices rose on Friday after U.S. jobs data and long-awaited stress tests on U.S. banks were better than expected, bolstering rising hopes of an improving American economy.
The dollar slumped against the yen and the euro, which surged to a one-month high above $1.35, as the labor market news dried up safe-haven flows into the U.S. currency.

Although the data showed a smaller-than-expected drop in U.S. payrolls, the news failed to dispel the likelihood of heavy job losses in the months ahead, leading Treasury debt prices to rise.

"The market is positioning for recovery over the next few months, which means the dollar will clearly see considerable weakness as this plays out," said Melvin Harris, chief market strategist at Advanced Currency Markets in New York.
"The jobs data was encouraging, and any trader would tell you they've expected to see unemployment at 9 to 10 percent before this thing was over, so that's not a shock," he said.

Copper prices fell as analysts said confidence in a global recovery was rising, but warned that signs of genuine demand were still scarce and supportive buying from China could subside.
