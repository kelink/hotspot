Track China's Leaders
MUNICH - Siemens Chief Executive Peter Loescher is to leave the company, four years before the end of his contract, after the German engineering group this week issued its second profit warning this year.
NEW YORK - Small business owners plan for growth this year but are closely tracking recent interest rate rises and any impact they might have on their business and customers, according to a spot survey of firms in the New York region.

The China Times newspaper said the Shanxi mills had achieved a better price than Japanese and South Korean steel companies, which agreed a 33 percent price cut with Australian miners earlier this month.
Officially, China is still refusing to budge in its attempt to secure a 40 percent cut from the big three suppliers -- BHP Billiton (
) of Australia and Brazil's Vale (
) -- but with less than two weeks to go before negotiations end, individual steel mills have been seeking their own agreements.
Citing Zhu Fengliang, secretary general of the Shanxi Iron and Steel Association, the Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper reported on Friday that a number of steel enterprises in the province had already jointly negotiated supply deals with overseas miners.
The China Iron and Steel Association has said previously the validity of contracts would not be recognized, adding that it could revoke the import licenses of any enterprise that undermined China's negotiating position.
However, traders have suggested the association was likely to turn a blind eye to individual steel mills signing independent long-term contracts with foreign miners should the annual negotiations end without reaching a final settlement.
