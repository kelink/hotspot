(Reuters) - A senior official of Chinese metals group Chinalco resisted plans to change the proposed $19.5 billion investment in Rio Tinto, the Financial Times said on Monday.
Wang Wenfu, president of Chinalco Overseas Holdings, dismissed demands by some Rio shareholders to be given the same opportunity as Chinalco to buy convertible bonds.
"This investment is a package," he was quoted as saying in an interview.
It is also planning to pay Rio $12.3 billion for minority stakes in some of the mining group's best operations.
Opponents of the deal say it ignores existing shareholders' pre-emptive rights to refinance the company without their stakes being diluted.
"We respect the rights of shareholders," he was quoted as saying.
Referring to the short-term market volatility, he added: "I am not sure the current market is sustainable.
"We have seen some recoveries that don't continue."
