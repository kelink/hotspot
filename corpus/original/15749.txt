(Reuters) - Stocks rose and U.S. government bonds fell on Thursday on stronger-than-expected U.S. jobless claims data and a sign of improving business conditions, which helped European stocks recover from losses.
The data, seen as a sign the U.S. recession might be reaching bottom, pushed the U.S. dollar down against the euro. In the darkest days of the economic crisis, the dollar rallied in safe-haven buying, but recent signs of recovery have tended to reverse those flows.
The government reports showed the number of people staying on U.S. jobless benefits after collecting an initial week of aid fell for the first time since January, while manufacturing in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic area contracted in June much less severely than expected. For details see [ID:nN18379372].

Adding to the selling in Treasuries were worries over pending government debt supply. The Treasury on Thursday said it will sell $104 billion of notes next week, which will be a record sale of coupons in one week.
"That is going to be troublesome next week, and that could cause some selling pressure," said John Canavan, market strategist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, New Jersey.
The rise in U.S. equities, in turn, helped European stocks stage a recovery from early losses. The FTSEurofirst 300
UK data showed retail sales fell unexpectedly in May, tempering recent optimism about the global economy. Britain's factory orders fell slightly more than expected in June, with export orders recording their biggest drop in more than a decade.
