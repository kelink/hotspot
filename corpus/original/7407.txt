), China's largest listed gold company, has offered $498 million for Indophil Resources NL (
), chasing the Australian miner's one-third stake in a big copper and gold lode in the Philippines.
In the latest swoop on an Australian miner by resource-hungry Chinese firms, Zijin offered A$1.28 a share, an 18 percent premium to Indophil's last trade before the offer, Indophil said on Tuesday. Indophil has recommended the offer.
Indophil shares jumped 10.6 percent to A$1.20, below the offer price, indicating investors are not holding out for a higher bid. Zijin's shares rose 4.2 percent to HK$8.46.
Indophil has a 34 percent stake in the $5.2 billion Tampakan copper and gold project in southern Philippines, controlled by Xstrata. Its only other assets are exploration prospects in the Philippines.
The deposit holds 13.5 million tonnes of copper and 15.8 million ounces of gold, which geologists believe can be extracted at a cost that is a fraction of today's copper and gold prices.
Discovered in 1991, the mine has never left the drawing board, dogged by environmental and economic problems, political instability and laws restricting foreign ownership.
"Xstrata welcomes the introduction of a joint venture partner with the capacity to support the advancement of the Tampakan project," Xstrata Copper Chief Executive Charlie Sartain said in a statement.
"There will be no change in the management or operation of the Tampakan project as a result of Zijin's proposed takeover offer," Xstrata Copper said.
Zijin's offer for Indophil is pitched at more than 10 times the price Xstrata paid for its 62.5 percent stake in Tampakan.
