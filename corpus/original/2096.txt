(Reuters) - Two more bodies of Kazakh border guards have been discovered at a burnt-out border post near the frontier with China, the border guard service said on Friday, bringing the death toll in an unexplained incident to 15.
"The total number of the dead are 14 servicemen and one civilian - a gamekeeper from a local game reserve," the service said in a statement.
"The forces of border guards, national security bodies and police continue their investigative and search actions," it said, adding that the dead would be sent to the capital Astana for examination by forensic experts.
Kazakhstan, which gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, shares a 1,530-km (960-mile) border with China and exported goods worth more than $16 billion to its neighbor last year, more than 18 percent of its total export revenues.
Last Monday, May 28, was the annual Soviet-era holiday for border guards, an event still celebrated in former Soviet countries. The bodies were discovered on May 30.
Shootouts between drug traffickers and militants occur sporadically in other Central Asian countries, particularly Tajikistan, which shares a border with Afghanistan and lies on a conduit for Afghan opiates en route to Russia and beyond.
