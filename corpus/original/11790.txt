(Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries edged down in Asia on Tuesday with investors trimming safe-haven buying of bonds as regional stock markets stabilised after the previous day's tumble.

* Market players said Monday's rally in longer-dated Treasuries was driven by Wall Street's fall and by hedge funds buying in a thin market with many investors away for their summer holidays.
* The benchmark 10-year note edged down 5/32 in price to yield 3.496 percent US10YT=RR, up about 2 basis points from late New York trade on Monday when the yield fell to 3.47 percent, its lowest since July 22.
* The 30-year bond fell 11/32 in price to yield 4.349 percent US30YT=RR, up 2 basis points. The two-year notes inched down 1/32 in price to yield 1.045 percent US2YT=RR, up around 2 basis points.
* But many investors have not yet been able to buy enough longer-dated Treasuries due to the rapid drop in such yields since last week, the trader said. That may provide near-term support to the Treasury market, though stock market moves will be a bigger driver, he added.
* The yield spread between two-year and 10-year notes stood at 245 basis points, the smallest in two weeks, with the curve flattening as investors scooped up longer maturities.
* On Tuesday, investors will also be looking to data on home construction and producer prices, analysts said. (Editing by Chris Gallagher)
