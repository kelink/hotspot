Oil prices unlikely to spike: BP economist

(Reuters) - Oil prices are unlikely to spike to worryingly high levels in the next two to three years due to rising spare capacity and relatively low demand growth, BP's (
Crude hit a record high near $150 a barrel in July 2008, due in part to concerns production would fail to keep pace with demand from emerging economies like India and China. Oil was trading above $73 on Tuesday.
"There will soon be 6 million barrels per day (bpd) of spare production capacity," BP's Christof Ruhl told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in London.
"In the good years, global demand was rising by 1.2 million bpd each year -- so even if the good years were to return tomorrow, it would still take more than three years to burn through that spare capacity and to create markets as tense as they were a year ago.
"In that perspective, I don't think we have any reason to suspect oil price peaks in the next two-three years."
Ruhl sees global oil demand growth returning in 2010, after consumption fell from a peak above 86 million bpd in 2007 to near 84 million bpd this year.
Still, the rate of demand growth next year is expected to be around 700,000 bpd, just over half what it was between 2004 and 2008. OPEC in a report on Tuesday forecast a similar growth rate.
"The five years before the economic crisis globally were the second-highest period of growth ever. For non-OECD it was the highest growth ever, so it is unlikely that it goes back to that again," Ruhl said.
"We're seeing some strength in the economy right now but it has the nature of a bounce," Ruhl said.
"It's based on two things in the OECD -- the inventory cycle, which normally lasts between 12 and 18 months and then all the public money that has been spent."
