(Reuters) - The European Union must raise its emissions targets if it is to compete with the likes of China, Japan or the United States in the race for green technology, ministers from the bloc's most powerful nations said.
Writing in the Financial Times, British Energy Minister Chris Huhne, German Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen and French Ecology Minister Jean-Louis Borloo urged the EU to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from the current 20 percent target by 2020.
"If we stick to a 20 percent cut, Europe is likely to lose the race to compete in the low-carbon world to countries such as China, Japan or the U.S. -- all of which are looking to create a more attractive environment for low-carbon investment," they wrote in a column published on the FT's website on Wednesday.
But the ministers said the recession had knocked a third off the cost of meeting the current goal, and failing to deepen the cuts now would lead to higher costs in the future.
"Ducking the argument on 30 percent will put us in the global slow lane," the ministers wrote.
"It is a policy for jobs and growth, energy security and climate risk. Most of all, it is a policy for Europe's future."
