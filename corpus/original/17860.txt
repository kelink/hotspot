Advertisers remained cautious overall during the first quarter as the global economic slowdown continued, Chief Executive William Ding said in a release.

NetEase's quarterly earnings rose to $61.0 million, or 47 cents per American Depositary Share, compared with $39.4 million, or 30 cents per ADS, a year earlier.
