U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke wrote to top government officials in Russia and China to urge them to end the bans, and said he raised the issue in person with China's ambassador.
"Government actions during this time of economic uncertainty and international concern about influenza must be based on scientific evidence," Locke wrote.
