(Reuters) - Global banking institutions support "far-reaching" regulatory reforms that include higher capital requirements but warn that rushed judgements could hinder financial market recovery, the Institute of International Finance said in a report on Thursday.
The IIF, whose members include top executives from JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank AG and the Bank of China, said in the report that "business as usual" was not an option, and pledged to promote many changes planned by governments to strengthen their collective credibility.
This includes reducing the leverage, or debt, at the heart of the turmoil sustained by many financial institutions, the report said. Consistent guidelines around the world are crucial, it added.
While the report details an industry mea culpa, the group also stressed that tighter rules could be counterproductive at a time when governments are working to resuscitate slumping economies, as well as financial markets. Firms must be able to generate reasonable returns to be viable, which itself stimulates economic activity, it said.
"Material error in the calibration of new prudential requirements would have major negative effects, not just on the financial industry but on national economies," said the authors, including Josef Ackermann, chairman of Deutsche Bank's management board, and William Winters, co-chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase Investment Bank.
In particular, the group said it was concerned that international financial markets would become "fragmented" by national regulatory measures that are not coordinated.
It also warned that restricting the size of financial institutions would not protect against systemic risks. That said, no firm should be considered too big to fail, and regulators should make it a priority to adopt reforms that allow for the orderly wind-down of any company.
