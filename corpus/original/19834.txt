TAKE-A-LOOK: World stocks up on Wells Fargo, crude oil off
Wed  EDT
Record profit at Wells Fargo, and rising American home prices in February, helped U.S. and European stocks rebound on Wednesday as oil prices fell on a jump in crude stocks and a gloomy IMF global growth forecast.

The MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS was up 0.5 percent, having dipped in and out of positive territory earlier in the session.
