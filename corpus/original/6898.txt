(Reuters) - Nigeria's privatization body said it had cleared up any confusion over China Unicom's involvement in a $2.5 billion bid for the former state telecoms monopoly, allowing it to go for final approval.
), China's second biggest carrier, little known Dubai company Minerva and a small local carrier.
Doubts arose when Unicom denied any involvement, but the Chinese firm later acknowledged its European unit had shown interest in joining the group bidding for Nitel but had never entered formal negotiations.
"There must have been a communication gap between Unicom Europe and Unicom China," said Taiwo Osipitan, head of the technical committee of the National Council on Privatization (NCP), on Thursday.
"In the light of this, we have resolved to recommend to the NCP that the result of the bid be accepted," he said.
Nigeria has been trying to sell Nitel for almost a decade and the controversy over the latest effort to do so is embarrassing for sub-Saharan Africa's second biggest economy.
