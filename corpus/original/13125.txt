(Reuters) - China will release revised steel industry consolidation guidelines in September as it moves to reform the world's largest but most fragmented market, the official Shanghai Securities News reported on Wednesday.
The detailed guidelines would be more practicable and include feedback from major domestic steel mills, the newspaper said, citing sources at the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The new consolidation guidelines would restrict production capacity by setting up references on emissions and environmental impact, instead of setting a minimum size for blast furnaces, and would balance tax income interests for multi-province consolidation, the newspaper said.
Beijing has been working to consolidate the country's fragmented steel sector for several years, partly to bolster China's bargaining position for iron ore supplies from top miners BHP Billiton (
), Rio Tinto (
) and Brazil's Vale (
However, progress has been slow as many steelmakers built large blast furnaces to meet government size requirements, adding to excess capaity, while some local governments have expressed concern about losing tax income from multi-province steel mill mergers or downsizing.
China's steel industry is weighed down by excess capacity, with production in 2008 of 500 million tonnes overshadowed by about 650 million tonnes in annual capacity. Demand in 2009 is expected to be capped at 550 million tonnes.
The country's largest steelmaker is Baosteel Group, the parent company of Baoshan Iron & Steel Co Ltd (
), but the fragmented nature of the sector means it accounts for less than 10 percent of crude steel output. (Reporting by Alfred Cang; Editing by Chris Lewis)
