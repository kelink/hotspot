Challenge for stevia sweetener is to woo consumers

(Reuters) - The challenge for natural sweetener stevia is to convince consumers, but for now volumes are tiny, industry expert Simon Bentley, a consultant with UK consultancy LMC International, said on Wednesday.
The plant, whose full name is stevia rebaudiana bertoni, belongs to the chrysanthemum family, originating in South America, in Paraguay and Brazil.
China dominates world production, with smaller volumes in Brazil, Paraguay and India.
Although industry leaders such as Coca Cola, Pepsi and Cargill have started buying it, it is still largely unproven in the market place.
Pure Circle and GLG farm stevia, which may be combined with other sweeteners in blends.
"The real test will be how consumers take to it," Bentley said in a presentation.
"At present supply of the leaves is limited mainly to small holder farms in China and refining tends to take place elsewhere," Bentley said, without giving further details.
Stevia has a low caloric value, and is suitable for diabetics because it does not raise blood sugar levels. However, less refined products have more "off tastes."
