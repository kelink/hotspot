(Reuters) - Singapore will revise its laws this year to improve disclosure on foreigners evading income taxes in their home countries, its finance minister told his Japanese counterpart, a Japanese Finance Ministry official said.
Japanese Finance Minister Kaoru Yosano welcomed Singapore Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam's pledge, the official told reporters after the two met on Monday.
World leaders said at a Group of 20 summit this month that they would crack down on tax havens, including sanctions against non-cooperative jurisdictions, by using information from the OECD.
Singapore's government has previously denied suggestions that the country is a tax haven. For analyses on banking secrecy see [ID:nLD101464] and [ID:nL0581127].

"On the margin it would make Singapore less attractive," said David Cohen of Action Economics. "I think there are enough other attractions for investors looking for channels for investing in Asian companies and markets," he said, adding these included a wealth management business with good insight into the region.
Tharman also told Yosano that he hoped officials could agree on a broad range of measures, including expanding currency swaps, at a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China, South Korea and Japan on May 3, according to the official.
