(Reuters) - China Thursday warned France not to grant exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama honorary citizenship of Paris when he visits next month, saying it would only anger the Chinese people.
Last year, China pulled out of an EU summit that France was to host after President Nicolas Sarkozy met the Dalai Lama, whom Beijing brands a separatist.
"A year ago, the city of Paris made a decision to make the Dalai Lama a so-called honorary citizen, which made the Chinese people very angry," Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu told a regular news briefing.
"If the city of Paris makes him a so-called honorary citizen, it will certainly once again be opposed by the Chinese people. We demand the Paris city government stop all actions which interfere in China's internal affairs and not make the same mistakes again and again on the Tibet issue."
"We hope the French side ... pushes forward the healthy and stable development of Sino-French ties," Ma added.
Beijing calls the Dalai Lama a reactionary who seeks to split off nearly a quarter of the land mass of the People's Republic of China. It has been using its diplomatic clout to try to block the pro-Tibetan message.
The 1989 Nobel Peace laureate denies the charge and says he seeks only greater rights, including religious freedom, and real autonomy for Tibetans.
The Dalai Lama, together with tens of thousands of exiled Tibetans, has lived in India since he fled Lhasa in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule.
