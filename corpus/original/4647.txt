(Reuters) - Chinese authorities have detained at least 22 people in connection with the use of illegal additives fed to pigs, state news agency Xinhua said on Thursday, in China's latest food safety scandal.
Police have detained 14 people, including pig farm managers, in the central province of Henan, one of the country's major pig breeding areas, after pigs tested positive for additives poisonous to humans, Xinhua said, citing a government statement.
Police have detained another eight people in the central city of Nanjing where a slaughterhouse was found to have handled some of the tainted meat, Xinhua added.
State television this week named Henan Shuanghui Investment & Development Co Ltd, the country's top meat processor, as one of the main companies that had sold the contaminated pork.
Shuanghui, which counts Goldman Sachs Inc. among its investors, has already shut down the processor affected by the contamination.
The government is also investigating over 1,300 pig farms and 130 feed and veterinary drug stores, Xinhua said, and at least six officials and workers at local animal quarantine stations have been fired or suspended from work.
The pigs were fed the additives -- described by state media as either ractopamine and/or clenbuterol -- to produce lean meat. Lean meat sells for a premium in China, the world's largest producer and consumer of pork.
In 2008, at least six children died and nearly 300,000 fell ill from drinking powdered milk laced with melamine, an industrial compound added to fool inspectors by giving misleadingly high results in protein tests.
Last month, state media reported some manufacturers had illegally added a leather protein powder to dairy products in an effort to cheat protein-content checks.
