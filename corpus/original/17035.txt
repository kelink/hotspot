(Reuters) - Miner Rio Tinto (
) sees a risk that a strong rally in copper prices may reverse over the next six to nine months, the chief executive of its copper unit said on Tuesday.
"Underlying demand fundamentals have not necessarily supported the increase in prices," Bret Clayton told the Mining Investment Congress in London, referring to demand in huge copper consumer China.
Big gains in copper prices this year have been helped by Chinese restocking, strategic buying and some speculation, not just end-user consumption, he added.
Although the short-term is uncertain, Rio is bullish on copper over a three- to five-year timeframe due to supply issues and resumption of strong demand from China and India.
"We're not quite sure when the turnaround will happen ... we're running our business for things to be tough through 2010," Clayton said.
The global downturn, however, has led to lower costs as prices of inputs such as oil and steel have slumped.
"We've been mildly surprised with how fast costs have started to come down," he said. "We've budgeted for significant cost reductions and we've exceeded those cost reductions in our own operations." (Reporting by Eric Onstad; Editing by David Holmes)
