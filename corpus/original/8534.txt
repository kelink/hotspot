(Reuters) - Chilean miner Antofagasta Plc (
In August, the London-listed group raised its full-year copper production forecast to about 447,000 tonnes but this is still 6.4 percent lower than its output last year.
"As forecast, production (in the third quarter) decreased compared with the same period in 2008 mainly due to lower throughput at Los Pelambres," Antofagasta said in a statement said on Tuesday, adding that there was more hard primary ore its flagship mine.
"Cumulative production in the first nine months of the year was slightly ahead of budget at 328,100 tonnes," it said.
To meet the full-year target, Antofagasta would have to increase output in the fourth quarter by 8 percent from the third quarter level of 109,900 tonnes.
Citigroup said in a note that production was largely in line with its forecast, but it advised investors to wait for share price declines as a cheaper re-entry point. It rates the firm as "hold" with a price target of 850 pence.
Antofagasta shares, which have rebounded by 80 percent this year, had shed 2.14 percent to 777 pence by 1228 GMT, outperforming a 3.42 percent decline in the UK mining index .FTNMX1770 as copper prices fell.
Antofagasta -- which saw output of byproduct molybdenum rise 10.5 percent to 2,100 tonnes -- said its expansion projects were on schedule.
The company's key Esperanza mine project and Los Pelambres expansion are on track to help lift output to around 700,000 tonnes of copper by 2011, up nearly 50 percent from 2008.
On Sept. 22, the head of Antofagasta's mining division said he expected higher-than-expected earnings for the third quarter on recovering copper and molybdenum prices. [ID:nN22363530]
Earnings per share for the first half dropped 70 percent, more than expected, due to weak prices and lower output. [ID:nL0475051]
Benchmark copper prices on the London Metal Exchange MCU3 have more than doubled this year, led by demand from top consumer China, but are still almost 30 percent below the record highs of $8,940 a tonne reached last July.
