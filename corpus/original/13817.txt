(Reuters) - The bid deadline for private equity-backed Kosmos Energy's Ghanaian oil interests has been extended from Friday and another date will be announced within the next 30 days, two sources familiar with the matter said.
A potential sale of the stake, in the Jubilee Field in Ghana's deep waters, is being closely watched as the asset is one of the largest oil finds in West Africa in the past decade.
Predicted to hold 1.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, the entire field is valued at $15 billion and analysts have said the stake could be valued at $3 billion to $5 billion.
Any bid would need to be vetted by the Ghanaian government. Extending the deadline will lengthen the auction process, but should shorten the time between signing and closing the deal, the sources said. It allows the Ghanaian government to be more involved in the auction before a winner is picked.
Kosmos Energy has been considering selling its stake in the large Jubilee oil field offshore Ghana for several months, sources have previously told Reuters. Other options that remain under consideration include an initial public offering, the sources said.
