China to perfect gas pricing mechanism this year

(Reuters) - China said on Monday it will perfect its natural gas pricing mechanism and push forward reforms on power prices this year, part of efforts to encourage energy savings and change its energy-intensive development mode.
It will reform power transmission and distribution tariffs, rationalize the relationship between coal and power prices, while taking into account environmental and safety issues in coal costs, the State Council, China's cabinet, said in a notice on its website (www.gov.cn).
The rhetoric, similar to what it had said before, comes as the global financial crisis has hit economic growth and when some stalled reforms have undermined the efficiency of the economy.
China's state-set gas prices are generally lower than those for its alternative energies and diversified across regions, industries and even users, a hindrance to expanding the use of the clean energy.
China relies on coal, and gas accounts for a fraction of consumption.
The country's major power firms and coal miners are still in a tussle over term contract coal prices for 2009 as coal firms insist on a rise while power companies refuse to accept increases due to state-caps on power prices.
China split its power monopoly in 2002 into five major power generating groups and two grid operators, but further reform of the grids has bogged down ever since partly because of frequent power shortages and resistance.
The State Council said in the notice it will step up separating non-core businesses from the grids and revamp power systems in rural areas, adjusting categories of power selling prices, reducing cross-subsidies between different power users and promoting direct deals between power generators and end-users.
China introduced a "perfected" fuel pricing mechanism from the beginning of this year that aims to bring local prices more in line with crude oil costs, but it has been loosely implemented in recent months despite surges in crude prices.
