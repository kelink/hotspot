(Reuters) - China has sentenced eight Tibetans to up to seven years in jail for their role in anti-government protests earlier this year, the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy said.
The six monks and two lay people were from Machen county in western Qinghai province, large swathes of which are ethnically Tibetan areas and include the birthplace of exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.
Hundreds of people rioted and attacked a police station in March, after a monk escaped from custody and jumped into a river. Exiles said he had committed suicide.
Police detained almost 100 monks after the violence abated, state media reported at the time.
The eight who were sentenced on Aug. 13 were found guilty of inciting protests and demonstrations against the Chinese government, said the report from the Tibetan rights group, based in the Indian hill town of Dharamsala that is home to the Dalai Lama's self-proclaimed government-in-exile.
A government official from Machen county, who gave only his surname Wang, confirmed that eight Tibetans had been sentenced but said the longest term was two years. He said he did not know what they had been charged with.
In March 2008 deadly riots broke out in Tibet's regional capital Lhasa after several days of peaceful protests by monks against Chinese rule. The violence killed 19 people and sparked waves of protests in Tibetan areas. Tibetan exiles say more than 200 people died in the crackdown.
This year, a tight web of troops and police throughout Tibetan areas deterred large-scale unrest. A trickle of isolated protests, including a monk who set himself on fire at a monastery in western Sichuan, suggested lingering discontent.
