) and its top executives on Wednesday, claiming they made incomplete or false reports that caused shareholders to buy stock at artificially inflated prices.
The company's games include World of Warcraft, Soul of the Ultimate Nation, Granado Espada, EA Sports FIFA Online 2 and Atlantica. The9 operated other licensed games in China and was developing several proprietary games, the lawsuit in Manhattan federal court said.
It said shareholders were seeking compensatory damages and interest to be determined at trial on behalf of all buyers of American Depository Shares of The9 between Nov. 15, 2006 and July 15, 2009.
Part of the lawsuit centers on a The9 affiliate's agreement with Vivendi Universal Games to license World of Warcraft (WoW) in China from mid-June 2005.
It said that on Feb. 23, 2006 the company reported fourth-quarter and unaudited fiscal 2005 financial results, including net revenues attributable to WoW, of $26.2 million in the fourth quarter, a 15 percent increase from the third quarter.
"This was the first time that The9 had revealed to the investing public that it had no controls in place to ensure that its revenue reports concerning WoW were accurate," the complaint said.
The shareholder is also suing former Chief Financial Officer Hannah Lee, her successor in February 2008 Tony Tse and his successor George Lai in July the same year.
