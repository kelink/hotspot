(Reuters) - China Steel (
), Taiwan's top steel maker, plans to resume operations of a key blast furnace earlier than planned due to steady global prices as inventories were digested after demand picked up.
One of China Steel's four blast furnaces that was shut in mid-April for maintenance could resume its operations from late August as demand improved in the United States, China and Taiwan, a company source told Reuters on Tuesday.
"We have to act quickly once the market is faring well," said the source, who declined to be unidentified because he was not authorised to speak to the media.
"In fact, there is room for us to raise prices."
The No. 3 blast furnace of China Steel, which helps produce a third of its annual output of 10 million tonnes, had been set to resume operations in early September previously.

China Steel, which was in the black last year, posted a loss of T$7.176 billion ($219 million) in the first quarter due to the global downturn, but it was likely to return to profitability in the third quarter, analysts said.
"Based on the market situation, it won't be so much of a problem if companies produced more steel," said Jack Chang, an analyst at Yuanta Securities.
China Steel's Taipei shares outperformed the broad market's 0.21 percent gain to end 0.5 percent higher at T$30.20, hitting the strongest level this year. (Writing by Lee Chyen Yee, Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
