(Reuters) - Spanish savings bank La Caixa will continue to aim for overseas expansion despite the global financial crisis, given the difficulty in growing market share at home, its managing director said on Tuesday.
"Growing our market share in Spain is complicated. We need to internationalise the group. We know this process is difficult and costly, but it is necessary," Juan Maria Nin said during a financial conference.
"We need to learn from other banks which have expanded overseas," he said.
Spain's biggest savings bank began its international growth in 2007 and has made acquisitions in the United States, China and Eastern Europe.
"We have scrupulously focused on the equity story when investing overseas," Nin said.
La Caixa's international investments have been handled by its industrial holding, Criteria CRIT.MC, which also has stakes in several leading Spanish blue chips including infrastructure group Abertis (
La Caixa listed part of Criteria on Oct. 9, 2007, just as the Spanish market was beginning to reflect the impact of the financial crisis.
"Criteria was the last important stock market listing in Spain ... We did the roadshow just in time," Nin said.
Apart from overseas expansion, La Caixa's strategy is also focused on expanding its private banking business and its presence in the small and mid-sized companies segment. "We have a lot to improve on in the area of private banking," Nin said.
La Caixa bought Morgan Stanley's wealth management business in Spain last year, an operation Nin described as "extraordinarily" successful. (Reporting by Judy MacInnes and Andres Gonzalez, editing by Will Waterman)
