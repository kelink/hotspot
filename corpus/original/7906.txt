(Reuters) - British engineer Fenner Plc (
) posted a drop in full-year adjusted pretax profit, which was in line with expectations, and said it was seeing a pickup in volumes, sending its shares up 4 percent.
Fenner, which makes and distributes conveyor belts for the mining and power generation markets, said its conveyor belt business had made a positive start to the year with the growth trend continuing in Asia-Pacific.
The outlook for 2010 is reasonably positive, Chief Executive Mark Abrahams told Reuters by phone.
Fenner is planning to expand business in China and recently upgraded plants in India, Abrahams said.
Brokerage Brewin Dolphin said the company's conveyor belt unit saw robust demand from coal miners and the new manufacturing operations had started contributing.
The brokerage said it would increase its 2010 pretax profit forecast and planned to raise its price target on the stock. It maintained a "conviction buy rating" on Fenner's stock.
Fenner said for the past several months its advanced engineered products unit benefited from customers' ending destocking.
For the year ended Aug 31, Fenner posted an adjusted pretax profit of 31.1 million pounds ($52.05 million) compared with 41.3 million pounds a year ago.
Revenue rose 14 percent to 499.4 million pounds, helped by acquisitions.
Shares of the company were up 3 pence at 167 pence at 0953 GMT on the London Stock Exchange. They touched a high of 170.55 pence earlier in the session. ($1=.5975 Pound) (Reporting by Shivani Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Ratul Ray Chaudhuri)
