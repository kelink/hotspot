(Reuters) - U.S. crude oil futures seesawed near unchanged on Friday, but only after surging to a seven-month high above $70 a barrel on data showing U.S. nonfarm payrolls fell much less than expected in May.
"Crude futures fell back here on profit-taking after the high above $70. The unemployment numbers were great in that there were fewer people losing their jobs, but the rate of unemployment rose more than expected," said Phil Flynn, analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago.
U.S. employers cut 345,000 jobs in May, the fewest since September and far less than forecast, according to a government report on Friday. However, the Labor Department said the unemployment rate rose to 9.4 percent, highest since a matching rate in July 1983, from 8.9 percent in April. [ID:nN04486858]
March and April job losses were revised downward to show smaller declines of 652,000 and 504,000, respectively.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast non-farm payrolls dropping by 520,000 in May. The unemployment rate had been forecast to rise only to 9.2 percent.
"Better jobs data was already priced in and there's growing awareness that higher prices will make any recovery much shallower," said Mike Fitzpatrick, vice president at MF Global in New York, commenting on crude's pull back after the jump above $70 a barrel.
