(Reuters) - President Robert Mugabe's party walked out on Sunday of a meeting of cabinet members to review the work of a unity government it has formed with its opponents, angry over charges of election-rigging.
In a sign of the serious tensions in the six-months-old power-sharing administration, ZANU-PF members said they had abandoned the meeting over "provocative statements" by the head of a small political faction in the three-party coalition.
"The meetings were going on very well until this morning when Deputy Prime Minister Arthur Mutambara made some very provocative statements that the parliamentary and presidential elections of last year were all fraudulent, null and void," Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa told Reuters.
"We, members from the ZANU-PF side, walked out in protest at the reckless and irresponsible utterances by Professor Mutambara because they are intended at undermining the legitimacy of a party in the inclusive government," he said.
This weekend's discussions were meant to review the new unity government's economic programs. Meetings were chaired by Tsvangirai, head of the main Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and now prime minister.
Chinamasa said Mutambara had apologized for his statements, but ZANU-PF doubted his sincerity.
Asked whether this meant the unity government was in danger of collapse, Chinamasa told Reuters: "No, not at all. This is a very specific reaction to a specific problem."
Political analysts believe the Zimbabwe coalition members have little option but to hold together but there is serious tension over reforms, policies and appointments.
