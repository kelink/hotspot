China's Xi flexes muscle, chooses reformist VP: sources

(Reuters) - A reformist member of China's decision-making Politburo, Li Yuanchao, is set to become the country's vice president this week instead of a more senior and conservative official best known for keeping the media in check, sources said.
Li's appointment would be a sign that new Communist Party leader and incoming president Xi Jinping's clout is growing, a source with ties to the leadership said. Xi fended off a bid by influential former president Jiang Zemin to install propaganda tsar Liu Yunshan in the job, the source said.
The post of vice president is largely symbolic. However the job would raise Li's profile, give him a role in foreign affairs and further bolster Xi, who took the top jobs in the party and military at the Communist Party congress in November.
The promotion of Li may also signal a willingness on the part of Xi to pursue limited reforms that Li is known to have advocated in his previous posts, such as making the selection of Communist officials more inclusive.
Leadership changes in China are thrashed out behind closed doors through horse-trading between new leaders and outgoing or retired leaders anxious to preserve their influence and protect family interests, but reshuffles must go through a choreographed selection process.
Two other sources, who declined to be identified because it is sensitive to discuss elite politics with foreign media, also confirmed that Xi had decided to make Li his vice president rather than Liu.
The National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament, will vote in Xi and Li as president and vice president respectively on March 14. Li Keqiang, the party's new No.2 official, will succeed Wen Jiabao to become premier and oversee the economy and day-to-day running of the cabinet.
"Li Yuanchao will be vice president, not Liu Yunshan," the source with leadership ties said.
"It was Xi's decision and a sign he is strong and able to say 'no' to Jiang," the source told Reuters.
In November, Liu was promoted to the seven-man Politburo standing committee with responsibility for propaganda and ideology. He has also taken over two of Xi's previous positions: president of the Central Party School, which grooms up-and-coming cadres, and top seat on the Secretariat of the party's elite 205-member Central Committee.
Liu served as propaganda minister from 2002 to 2012, keeping a tight leash on domestic media and China's Internet, which has more than 500 million users.
His rival, Li, had been widely considered a top contender for a spot on the standing committee in November but party elders led by Jiang used a last-minute straw poll to block him from joining the body, sources have said.
The vice presidential appointment "in part is compensation for him not getting into the Politburo standing committee", said Guo Liangping, a Chinese politics expert at the National University of Singapore's East Asia Institute.
"That position has high exposure to the world, it's high profile, probably more prestigious, but in terms of real power it's limited."
If Li makes it, it would mark the first time since 1998 that the vice president is not a member of the standing committee - the apex of power in China. Li sits on the 25-member Politburo, one notch below the standing committee.
"This time it's kind of a holding position," said Kerry Brown, executive director of the China Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.
Li has been regarded as progressive for advocating incremental reforms in how the party promotes officials and consults the populace on policies, but how much influence he has as vice president will be, to a large degree, decided by Xi.
"If Xi wants a pro-active, tightly-allied kind of vice president, then the vice president will have power. If he wants a purely symbolic figure who is there to do absolutely nothing, then that's what the vice president will do," said Brown.
Li, a "princeling" whose father was a former vice mayor of Shanghai, earned mathematics and economics degrees from two of China's best universities and has a doctorate in law. He also spent time at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The caption reads, ¡°China¡¯s Xi flexes muscle, chooses reformist VP: sources¡± Ah, the game¡¯s afoot! ¡°Reformist¡±; ¡°dissident¡±; ¡°liberal¡±. All terms Communist strategists use to confound their enemies. You see, a Communist nation has but one priority: The neutralization of the United States. As such Communist nations resort to stratagems to hide their real intentions: ¡°Behind the impressive smokescreen of pseudo-democracy, pseudo-capitalism and pseudo-reform, this Russian-Chinese ¡®cooperation-blackmail¡¯ strategy is irreconcilably hostile to the West. Again, this is no mere presumption. It was explicitly confirmed in May 1994 to Clark Bowers, a member of an official US Republican delegation to Peking, by Mr Mo Xiusong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, who is believed to be the highest-ranking Chinese Communist official ever to have answered questions put to him by a knowledgeable Western expert on Communism: BOWERS: Is the long-term aim of the Chinese Communist Party still world Communism? Mo XIUSONG: Yes, of course. That is the reason we exist.¡± ¨C ¡°The Perestroika Deception¡± (1995), KGB defector Major Anatoliy Golitsyn. Deception is key to any chance of a Communist victory, which is why after the death of Stalin all Communist nations in 1960 signed onto a ¡°new¡± more subtle strategy to defeat the West with. The strategy is called the ¡°Long-Range Policy¡± (LRP). The last major disinformation operation under the ¡°new¡± strategy was the fraudulent collapse of the USSR in late 1991. The next major disinformation operation under the LRP will be the equally fraudulent collapse of the Chinese Communist government. This is why we are hearing so much lately about Chinese ¡°dissidents¡± and Chinese government ¡°reformers¡±. When the ¡°reformers¡± begin ¡°reforming¡± the system, the ¡°reforms¡± will, according to the script, take on a life of their own, bringing down the Communist government in Beijing.
