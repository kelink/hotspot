¡®Increased state expenditures on the army, bureaucracy, in welfare state commitments brought about a continual unbearable tax pressure. Tax pressure grew heavier and the tendency to evasion¡­ on the part of high officials and large landowners, was increased¡­ This vicious circle could lead only to one result¡­ The bankruptcy of the enormous [Roman] state at the same time privileged a few groups, while they evaded taxation, heap riches and create around their villas economic and social microcosms, completely cut off from central authority. It was the end of the Roman world.¡¯ ¨C Aurelio Bernardi it¡¯s all just a little bit of history repeating¡­. And kids today think learning history has no value. Humans are stupid. You can be sure we¡¯ve already made the same mistakes before, best we learn what we can from the past before the West becomes history.
