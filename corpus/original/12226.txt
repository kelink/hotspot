(Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said central banks need to ensure they have appropriate mechanisms in place to exit the extraordinary policy steps they have taken to help cope with a global crisis, the text of an Aug. 8 speech he made showed.
Measures that entail central banks taking on individual credit risk, such as corporate debt, are extraordinary steps because they come close to the area of fiscal policy, Shirakawa said.
"It would be important to have an appropriate built-in exit mechanism which reduces the incentive to use the facility as market functioning recovers," he told a conference in Shanghai co-hosted by the People's Bank of China and the Bank for International Settlements.
He also said some time would be needed before various excesses in the private sector, built up before the global financial crisis, are unwound and the economy can return to a sustainable growth path.

The BOJ has cut rates to near zero and taken unconventional steps to lessen the impact of the global financial crisis, such as by buying commercial paper and corporate bonds from banks.
Reflecting that improvement, the central bank last month extended these special measures by three months instead of the widely expected six. [ID:nT132248]
With the global economy emerging from the worst of the financial crisis, central banks have been debating how to exit extraordinary measures they have taken to beat a credit crunch.
The Federal Reserve, which meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, will debate whether to end a scheme to buy $300 billion of longer-dated Treasuries on schedule in September. [ID:nN07416548] (Reporting by Leika Kihara)
