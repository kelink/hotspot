(Reuters) - Hong Kong shares succumbed to profit-taking on Monday as investors digested mixed signals from the U.S. economy and held their breath for a raft of economic data from China and the United States this week.
But China-listed shares edged up, with financials helped by news of a possible tie-up between two heavyweights and property counters buoyed by strong sales in May.

"The general lack of willingness to sell among investors has made things difficult for fund mangers who are looking to take profit. The U.S. data on Friday again didn't set a clear direction."
Data on Friday showed U.S. employers cut 345,000 jobs in May -- substantially less than analysts had forecast -- but the U.S. unemployment rate hit 9.4 percent, its highest since 1983.

Analysts said a tie-up would be considered positive for both companies, with Ping An, which has a small banking unit, keen to build itself into a financial conglomerate.

Analysts said supportive steps for industries, such as a rise in export tax rebates, lifted sentiment, although IPOs, which have been suspended for nearly nine months, could resume at any time after the end of a comment period on new rules last Friday, and this could spur profit-taking.

The Ministry of Finance on Monday said China was increasing value added tax rebates to exporters of more than 600 product lines. [ID:nPEK38271] The news lifted a number of stocks, with Fujian Fynex Textile Science & Technology (
