Oil falls slightly as U.S. product stocks rise

(Reuters) - Oil fell slightly on Wednesday, weighed down rising U.S. stockpiles of gasoline and distillate fuels and weak demand.
U.S. gasoline stockpiles rose by 800,000 barrels in the week to July 17, matching analysts' expectations, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. <EIA/S>
Inventories of distillates, including heating oil and diesel, rose to a fresh 25-year high. The build came as demand for the fuels, which are linked to industrial activity, fell by 11 percent over the past four weeks against year-ago levels.
"Refiners are trying to protect their margins by whacking down the utilization rates, but although these were down by 2 percent, we still saw a build in distillates and gasoline," said Gene McGillian, analyst for Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
U.S. crude oil stocks fell by 1.8 million barrels, below analyst expectations for a 2.1 million barrel draw and a Tuesday report by the American Petroleum Institute which showed a 3.1 million barrel build.
Optimism that a turnaround in the economy could bolster fuel demand have help lift crude prices in recent months, and Kuwait's oil minister said on Wednesday a price near $65 a barrel is reasonable and good for the OPEC nation.
