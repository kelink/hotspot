(Reuters) - China's Ming Yang Wind Power Group Ltd (
), the world's largest turbine maker, denying a report that it was in talks to buy its Danish rival for up to $2.5 billion.
Vestas, often the subject of takeover speculation, has been hammered by a slump in demand for the wind energy industry, with government budget-cutting reducing support for renewable energy and financing for projects drying up.
Rising costs and fierce competition, including from Asian rivals, have only rubbed salt into the wounds.
"We have no plans at this stage to acquire Vestas," said Beatrice Li, spokeswoman for Guangdong-based Ming Yang, China's No 4. wind turbine maker. "There are no talks ongoing at this time."
Vestas' stock ended 2.4 percent lower on Monday after climbing as much as 6.9 percent on a report by Chinese web publication Caixin Online that Ming Yang was seeking to buy Vestas in a deal worth between 1.5 billion euros and 2 billion euros ($1.9 billion-$2.5 billion). Caixin cited a source close to the situation and an industry regulator.
Shares in Vestas lost two thirds of their value last year and have shed a further 53 percent since end-2011, reducing the company's market value to just 5.7 billion Danish crowns ($940 million).
