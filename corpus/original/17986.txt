), China's biggest contract chip maker, which counts Texas Instruments and Qualcomm among its clients, hopes to turn a profit as early as the fourth quarter due to improved demand from China.
Initial signs from Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp's big customers are pointing to a recovery, due largely to a pick-up in demand for consumer products such as cellphones.
"Our goal is to turn a profit next year," Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Chang told the Reuters Global Technology Summit from Shanghai. "Optimistically speaking, we could see a profit in the fourth quarter this year, otherwise the first half of next year."
SMIC's (
) capacity utilisation rate doubled to more than 70 percent in the current quarter from the first quarter, Chang said.
