(Reuters) - Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney and China's central bank chief, Zhou Xiaochuan, will discuss the upcoming G20 meeting in Pittsburgh at a meeting in China next week, a senior Canadian finance official said on Thursday.
The two governors will also assess their countries' respective fiscal and monetary stimulus policies and assess the state of the global economy and China's contribution to the recovery, the official said, on condition of anonymity, in a background briefing for journalists.
Carney will be joining Finance Minister Jim Flaherty in a visit to Beijing and Shanghai from Aug. 10 to 14, in which Flaherty will seek to open up new business opportunities for Canadian banks and insurance companies.
Julie Dickson, head of Canada's federal regulator, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, as well as other government officials and financial sector executives, will also participate in the Canadian mission to China.
The trip will help lay the groundwork for a trip to China later this year by Prime Minister Stephen Harper and was preceded by visits by the trade, foreign affairs and transport ministers.
The finance official said China is looking to Canada, where the banking system survived the global financial crisis without bankruptcies or bailouts, as playing a key role in reshaping the international financial architecture.
Flaherty, who also traveled to China in 2007 to drum up business for Canadian banks, will meet with representatives of China's banking and insurance regulators. (Reporting by Louise Egan; editing by Peter Galloway)
