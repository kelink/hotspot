(Reuters) - Brambles Ltd (
), the world's top pallet supplier, sees its earnings recovering due to a global economic turnaround, sending its shares up to a seven-month high.
It reported a 33 percent slide in net profit, not as bad as analysts had expected, as it snared new customers like Nestle (
), offsetting a slump in pallet use across North America and Europe, especially in auto parts transport.
"Despite the lower organic growth, the business has continued to win new business that should position it very well throughout the next 12 months," Credit Suisse analyst Anthony Moulder said in a note.
Brambles Chief Executive Mike Ihlein said he was confident the company was well positioned to speed up growth once its customers, who use its pallets to transport goods, start restocking, and had already benefited from growth in China and India.
"Nobody's exactly sure when the economy's going to recover. I expect it sooner rather than later," Ihlein told analysts.
"When I look at the potential for recovery, I think Brambles is particularly well-placed to benefit from that, in many respects much more so than many others."
The company will continue to use wooden pallets rather than plastic as used by some of its competitors in the United States, saying it made sense from a cost point of view. ($1=A$1.20) (Reporting by Denny Thomas;)
