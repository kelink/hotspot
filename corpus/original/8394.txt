(Reuters) - U.S. solar company Evergreen Solar Inc ESLR.O on Wednesday posted revenue and a quarterly loss that was better than expected, as the company increased production and sold everything it produced.
Revenue rose to $77.7 million in the third quarter, topping the $73.86 million analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The company reported a third quarter net loss of $82.4 million, or 40 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $24.6 million, or 19 cents per share, a year ago.
Those results included a charge of about $70 million for a write-down in the company's Sovello joint venture.
Excluding that charge, Evergreen Solar had a net loss of 6 cents per share, which beat the loss of 8 cents per share that analysts were expecting, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Evergreen's sequential shipments rose 35 percent to 31 megawatts in the third quarter and the company said that demand continues to be solid early in the fourth quarter.
The company said it will start to move panel assembly from its Devens, Massachusetts facility to China in mid-2010, but will keep making solar wafers and cells at the U.S. facility.
Evergreen Solar, based in Malboro, Massachusetts, makes solar equipment that turns sunlight into electricity.
Like other solar companies, Evergreen has been hit by a lack of financing for new projects and a glut of panels.
The company said in the third quarter it cut its manufacturing cost by 17 percent to $2.24 per watt. The company's cost-target for 2012 is $1 per watt.
Shares of the company were flat in extended trade after rising slightly. The stock closed down 4 percent at $1.42 on Wednesday on the Nasdaq. (Reporting by Laura Isensee; editing by Carol Bishopric, Bernard Orr)
