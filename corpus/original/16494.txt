) is offering to buy back $200 million of its 8.625 percent bonds maturing in 2013 HK025131436=RTR, according to a stock exchange filing on Tuesday from the Chinese property firm.
Investors tendering their SRE bonds by an early deadline of June 18 will receive up to 80 cents to the dollar, consisting of a basic offer price of 72.5 cents, a premium of 6.2 cents as an inducement to sell the debt early and 1.3 cents to consent to waiving certain bond covenants.
Bondholders will get paid less if they tender the debt after the early deadline. The final expiration date for the offer is on July 14. (For more details, see:
SRE's debt was trading at 66.5 cents to the dollar as of Monday.
Standard & Poor's said the offer did not constitute a distressed debt exchange, or when an issuer seeks to buy back debt at sharply discounted prices, triggering automatic default-type ratings from credit agencies. [ID:nWLA6191]
"In our view, the tender offer is not tantamount to a distressed exchange. We believe that an imminent default is unlikely if bondholders don't accept the offer because SRE's cash buffer is adequate and its property sales are improving," S&P said on Tuesday.
SRE plans to finance the tender offer via the sale of equity or equity-linked securities, according to its statement.
Deutsche Bank will handle the tender offer. (Reporting by Rafael Nam; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
