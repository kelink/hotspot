(Reuters) - China's Olympic and world badminton champion Lin Dan hopes to turn back the clock as part of his preparations for the 2012 London Games, local media reported on Monday.
Lin led the undefeated Chinese shuttlers to a seventh Sudirman Cup win in Guangzhou over the weekend and proved his strength by beating all five opponents including Malaysia's current world number one Lee Chong Wei 2-0 in the semi-finals.
After being named 2008 Player of the Year by the World Badminton Federation, the 25-year-old said the increased success had also brought greater pressure.
"I hope I can return to the Dan I was before 2008, and train myself as I used to," sina.com quoted Lin as saying.
Head coach Li Yongbo said the Chinese were still far from "unbeatable", but was confident their dominance in the sport would continue for some time.
"My biggest dream is that my son can become the 100th badminton world champion of China," said Li, whose 17-year-old son, Li Gen, has entered the national junior team as a doubles player. (Reporting by Liu Zhen and Nick Mulvenney; Editing by Nick Macfie and Peter Rutherford)
