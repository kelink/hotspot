Geithner and China's Wang to meet on Sunday

(Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Sunday will travel to Qingdao, China, to meet with Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan, a senior Treasury official said.
Geithner and Wang, who are designated as special representatives of their respective presidents on U.S.-China economic issues, will discuss "important bilateral economic matters," the official said, without elaborating.
The stop-off in China comes at the end of Geithner's trip to the Group of 20 finance ministers and central bank governors meetings here, where officials agreed to refrain from competitive currency devaluations and reduce current account imbalances.
Last week, Geithner delayed a semi-annual report to U.S. lawmakers on whether China manipulates its yuan for a trade advantage, choosing instead to press the issue at multilateral meetings including the Gyeongju finance leaders meeting and a G20 leaders summit next month in Seoul.
"China is well into a very promising and very ambitious program of domestic reforms to strengthen domestic growth because China recognized that it cannot afford to rely as it has in the past on such an export-dependent model for growth," Geithner told a news conference. "We want to see that progress continue."
"Of course as a part of that, it's not ready for its exchange rate to rise more rapidly in response to market forces," Geithner added of China.
Geithner made a similar stop-off in China on the way home from a trip to India in April, which also took place when the Treasury had delayed its currency report to allow Beijing more time to move on the yuan.
