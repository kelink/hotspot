(Reuters) - Zijin Mining (
), China's largest listed gold company, missed outbound investment opportunities because of inaccurate judgements, a senior executive said on Wednesday.
"In terms of overseas investment, there were inaccurate judgements of the mining market. Even though we've done a lot of work the achievement is not satisfactory," Zijin's chief executive Chen Jinghe told an industry forum in China's port city of Tianjin.
"We've got some projects that are not large-there is a difference from our expectations," he said.
Gold XAU= hit a record of above $1,070 last week on a weak U.S. dollar as the precious metal is often seen as a hedge against the dollar. It has risen more than 20 percent this year.
Zijin said in July that it had terminated share acquisition talks with a Kazakhstan gold company, but gave no reason for the termination.
It was in active pursuit of overseas resources and had made initial investigations into various overseas projects, although no agreements had been signed, the company said in a statement in July. (Writing by Alison Leung; Editing by Chris Lewis and Jonathan Hopfner)
