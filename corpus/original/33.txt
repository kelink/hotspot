(Reuters) - China's central bank announced long-awaited interest rate reforms on Friday, scrapping the floor on rates that banks charge clients for loans.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement on its website that rate reform will help lower financial costs for companies.
JOE NEIGHBOUR, SENIOR BROKER, CENTRAL MARKETS, LONDON:
"It's another method of easing and a form of looser monetary policy."
MARK WILLIAMS, CHIEF ASIA ECONOMIST, CAPITAL ECONOMICS:
"It's a very big deal, probably more in terms of what it symbolizes than the effect on the economy. China has been talking about interest rate liberalization for a long time, this is one of the biggest steps they could have taken.
"It does not necessarily change very much today, but it tells you something about the trajectory. Only a very small proportion of loans will be affected by this decision.
"Before today, banks were allowed to lend at no more than a 30 percent discount to the benchmark rate, but only 11 percent of loans were offered at any discount."
