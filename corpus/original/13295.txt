Taiwan's president chosen to be KMT chief

(Reuters) - Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou was chosen on Sunday to chair his ruling Nationalist Party (KMT), a party representative said, giving the China-friendly leader more control over the island's once icy relations with Beijing.
Control of the party, which has been quietly meeting with mainland Communist officials since 2005, would allow Ma more access to China, including the chance to visit in a non-government role.
"Ma will undoubtedly become the power center," said Raymond Wu, a political risk consultant in Taipei. "As chair of the ruling party, he can streamline the process of decision-making, especially for cross-Strait relations (with China)."
China has claimed sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan since 1949, when Mao Zedong's Communists won the Chinese civil war and Chiang Kai-shek's KMT fled to the island. Beijing has vowed to bring Taiwan under its rule, by force if necessary.
Ma was elected president in May 2008 on pledges to improve the island's economy by opening more trade channels with China, a global economic powerhouse, and ease tensions with Beijing.
The two sides have signed landmark trade and transit deals during Ma's term but have avoided sensitive political issues.
Ma led the party until early 2007, when he stepped down as chairman over a corruption indictment involving his term as Taipei mayor. He was later cleared.
Wu Poh-hsiung, who succeeded Ma, agreed this year to step down as chairman. Ma's intra-party election on Sunday was uncontested, and he is due to take the reins in September.
Ma, sometimes characterized as a loner in his own government, as party chairman would also gain more control over the KMT-controlled legislature, allowing speedier passage of bills, and have a strong voice in party nominees for local elections.
