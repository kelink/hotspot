METALS-Copper gains tempered by Chinese demand doubts

(Reuters) - Copper bounced from three-week lows on Tuesday as the dollar fell, but gains were tempered by perceptions that the road to economic recovery would be long.
Benchmark copper MCU3 on the London Metal Exchange ended at $4,805 from $4,761 at the close on Monday. Earlier on Tuesday the metal used in power and construction touched $4,685, the lowest since May 28.
A boost for industrial metals overall was the generally weaker dollar, which makes commodities priced in dollars cheaper for holders of other currencies. [USD/]
But while the Chinese economy is headed in the right direction, the foundations of the recovery are not yet solid, of the People's Bank of China said. [ID:nPEK123536]
China is the largest consumer of copper, accounting for about 30 percent of demand.
"An increasing number of commentators have questioned ongoing strength of commodity imports and/or demand from China," said John Reade, analyst at UBS. "I suspect we are going to see lower prices."
Weighing on copper in recent days has been the narrowing differential between prices in Shanghai and the LME, analysts said.
Chinese demand for copper is tailing off and talk that the country's State Reserves Bureau -- after building up substantial reserves this year -- was selling or lending copper in the domestic market has also undermined confidence.
"The actions of the SRB in copper - if true - could represent the first signs of a government crackdown on physical commodity speculation in China," Reade said.
Outside China, demand prospects are poor.
U.S. housing market data from the United States pointed to a sluggish economic recovery, while surveys of purchasing managers in the euro zone showed meaningful growth was unlikely to return before next year. [ID:nLN726029] [ID:nN23475172]
"Sentiment is a little bit fragile. People want to be sure economic growth is on the rebound but the data has not been uniformly strong," said analyst David Thurtell at Citi.
Aluminium was bolstered by worries about supplies in the short term, which are tighter partly because companies with metal are using it as collateral to release cash tied up in inventories. [ID:nLF699919]
The metal used in transport and packaging MAL3 closed at $1,605 a tonne from $1,574 at the close on Monday.
However, stocks in LME warehouses are holding near record highs above 4.35 million tonnes and concerns about an oversupplied market are expected to bear down on prices.
Zinc MZN3, used for galvanizing steel, ended at $1,519 from $1,502 and battery material lead MPB3 at $1,620 from $1,602 on Monday.
Tin MSN3 closed at $14,550 from $14,400 and stainless steel ingredient nickel MNI3 at $14,610 from $14,490. Metal Prices at 1613 GMT Metal Last Change Pct Move End 2008 Ytd Pct
