) said it won clearance to sell its 15.6 percent stake in Taikang Life, China's fourth-largest life insurer, to a group of shareholders for $1.2 billion.
AXA will now focus its Chinese strategy on its joint venture with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the world's most valuable lender, which bought a stake in AXA's life insurance venture in October.
"The sale of AXA's interest in Taikang Life, which was acquired through the Winterthur transaction in 2006, is motivated principally by Chinese regulatory positions restricting the ability of foreign investors to hold multiple interests in the Chinese life insurance sector," AXA said.
The transaction is expected to have a positive impact of about 800 million euros ($1.11 billion) on net income and reduce debt gearing by 1 percentage point in the first half of 2011, AXA said in a statement on Friday.
"The disposal price looks not that bad, six times book value is pretty much okay and it helps a bit to reduce the debt of AXA," WestLB analyst Andreas Schaefer said.
The completion of the transaction is subject to obtaining other approvals from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, which are pending, AXA said.
Shares of AXA, Europe's second-biggest insurer behind Allianz (
), were down 1.7 percent at 14.66 euros at 1607 GMT as the insurance sector reeled from a massive earthquake in Japan that triggered a 10-meter tsunami.
