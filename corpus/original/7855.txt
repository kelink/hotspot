), sending Taifook shares up as much as 23 percent on Thursday.
The company, which holds a 61.86 percent stake in Taifook, did not identify who it was in talks with in an announcement posted late on Wednesday. However, a local newspaper cited market rumours that China Construction Bank (
) (CCB), the country's second-largest lender by assets, could be the buyer.
Shares of Taifook hit an early high of HK$4.95, before settling at HK$4.72, up 17 percent, taking the valuation of the company to HK$3.33 billion ($429.7 million).
"The stock was boosted by rumours that CCB will buy the brokerage house," said Alfred Chan, chief dealer at Cheer Pearl Investment Ltd. "It is possible, as CCB wants to explore Hong Kong's stock market and Taifook has a good client base."
A Chinese bank and a Chinese securities house were bidding for Taifook, with CCB, the likely winner, prepared to offer about HK$4 per share, close to the closing price of HK$4.03 on Wednesday, the Oriental Daily quoted industry sources as saying.
The suggested offer price was a good premium to the company's net asset value, Chan said.
