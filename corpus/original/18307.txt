Track China's Leaders

Sen. Debbie Stabenow, one of a bipartisan group of legislators who introduced the new bill on Wednesday, said it was uncertain when or how the legislation would advance since she had no commitments from Senate leaders to move it forward.
The legislation, formally introduced on Wednesday, would allow companies to ask the government to impose anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports from any country whose currency has been "misaligned" for a prolonged period of time.
U.S. lawmakers have complained that China has manipulated its currency, but President Barack Obama's Treasury Department declined to formally label China as a currency manipulator despite Obama last year raising expectations that he would.
"We certainly would like to have this pass as quickly as possible, I don't have any commitments in terms of timeline at this point," Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, told reporters.
Stabenow said the White House had not revealed its position on the legislation, which was co-sponsored by Republican Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky and Representatives Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat, and Representative Tim Murphy, a Pennsylvania Republican.
The U.S. trade deficit with China widened to a record $266.3 billion in 2008. However, the gap has narrowed slightly in the first three months of 2009, as weaker demand amid a recession has cut China's exports to the United States by nearly 11 percent.
