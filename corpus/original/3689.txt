While scientists are uncertain if this new strain -- called H5N1-2.3.2.1 -- is more virulent in people, they said it was different enough from its predecessor to escape a human H5N1 vaccine that can tackle the parent strain.
"There is a human H5N1 vaccine candidate that is a (WHO)recommended vaccine ... But it doesn't confer full protection against the (new variant)," said leading virologist Malik Peiris at the University of Hong Kong.
The World Health Organization meets twice a year, in February and September, when experts discuss and decide on the makeup of candidate influenza vaccines.
H5N1 kills up to 60 percent of the people it infects. It has resurfaced in recent months, most notably in Cambodia where it has infected eight people this year, killing all of them.
"H5N1 cases in Cambodia always have high mortality because they are detected late," Peiris told Reuters in an interview.
"It doesn't necessarily indicate that this particular virus strain is more virulent to humans. But it is a threat because it has become more widespread globally."

Hey, if anyone is interested, there is a treatment that has been PROVEN in clinical studies in mice infected with the H5N1 virus to reduce and shorten the infection, with a 100% survival rate¡­un-treated group had 100% MORTALITY rate. Used in Perth, Australia trial showed very positive reaction, shortening the infection period and reducing the symptoms. Mild to NO side effects, stable at room temp for 2 years, 5 if refrigerated. orally administered lozenge (no vaccine), and because it stimulates your OWN immune system, nothing can become immune to it¡¯s effects. www.amarbio.com! Look up ¡°interferon¡± if you want to know how it works. It is truly the next leap forward in treating/preventing the flu (any flu!)!!

The WHO is licking their chops hoping to be able to declare another pandemic. I¡¯m sure they already have a statement prepared to that effect.
