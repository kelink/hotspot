The farmers, most of whom live along the stream that carries discharge from the mine, complain that it is no longer clear, impeding their ability to do laundry and other daily tasks, said the village party secretary, who gave his family name as Gao.
The number of farmers blocking the road had dwindled to about a dozen by Tuesday afternoon, Gao said.
Sino Gold said independent tests of the water had refuted the farmers' allegations.
"Sino Gold is working with the relevant authorities to resolve the situation and is optimistic that full gold production will resume shortly," it said, adding that it is taking a "non-confrontational" approach to the issue.
White Mountain, owned 95 percent by Sino Gold, started production in January and is scheduled to ramp up over the course of this year to a full rate of 65,000 ounces a year.
