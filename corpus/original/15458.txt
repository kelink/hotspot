(Reuters) - Chinese chemicals company Chemspec International Ltd CPC.N raised $72.7 million in its initial public offering on Tuesday after pricing its U.S. shares at $9 each, at the top end of its estimated price range, one of the deal's underwriters said.

Chemspec sold 8.08 million ADRs, of which 22 percent were held by existing shareholders.
The expected pricing on Tuesday of another IPO, by Chinese water treatment equipment supplier Duoyuan Global Water Inc DGW.N, was not yet determined by late evening, but would be disclosed by Wednesday morning before trading in New York begins, one of that deal's underwriters said.
Chemspec said in a filing in May that it is the largest manufacturer of fluorinated specialty chemicals in China with a market share there of approximately 25 percent in 2008, and global sales of $138.3 million in 2008.
Chemspec shares are set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning under the symbol 'CPC.N.' (Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)
