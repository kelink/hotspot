(Reuters) - North Korea's nuclear test threatens regional peace and warrants a firm response, European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana said on Monday.
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso also condemned Monday's underground test and called for a resumption of six-country talks with Pyongyang on ending its nuclear weapons programme.
"These irresponsible acts by North Korea warrant a firm response by the international community. The European Union will be in contact with its partners to discuss appropriate measures," Solana said in a statement.
The test was a "flagrant violation" of a United Nations Security Council resolution, the statement said.
North Korea's official KCNA news agency said the test was part of efforts by Pyongyang to strengthen its self-defence.
North Korea also launched two short-range missiles on Monday, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.
Barroso said of North Korea's moves: "We consider it a provocation and we strongly condemn them."
"At the same time, I think we should be ready to come back to the six-party talks and to try to work for a peaceful development in all the Korean peninsula," he told Reuters during a visit to the Danish capital, Copenhagen.
The talks with North Korea involve the United states, China, Russia, South Korea and Japan. The international community has tried measures ranging from promises of aid to economic sanctions to try to stop North Korea having a nuclear arsenal.
Pyongyang said it would no longer take part in the six-party talks in response to tighter international sanctions following its launch of a rocket in April that was widely seen as a disguised long-range missile. (Reporting by Gerard Wynn in Copenhagen and Dale Hudson; writing by Timothy Heritage)
