(Reuters) - European governments lag China and the United States in green investment to boost the economy, a senior European Commission official said on Monday.
Germany is leading the way in the 27-country European Union, with some of the bloc's newer and poorer member states in eastern Europe furthest behind, the head of the EU executive arm's environment department, Karl Falkenberg, told reporters.
"EU states spent three to 13 percent of recovery aid on what we would call green activities," he said. "On the U.S. side we come up with about 14 percent ... but we see China in the upper 30s."
The United States launched a $787 billion stimulus plan in February, and green projects will receive a boost under $80 billion of spending on transport infrastructure and $30 billion on energy.
"Our competitors are using the crisis in strengthening green products and services ... and moving to more efficient production and consumption patterns," Falkenberg said. "If we are not ready, others will simply take the market." (Reporting by Pete Harrison, additional reporting by Jan Strupczewski; editing by Jon Boyle)
