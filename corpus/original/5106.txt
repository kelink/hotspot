Factbox: How various industries use rare earth elements
2010-12-28 18:07:00.0
(Reuters) - Rare earth elements are in the the forefront of global worries over fears that China's policy of curbing exports will increasingly cause shortages in other industrialized economies, given its status as the dominant global supplier.
China announced on Tuesday it will cut its export quotas for rare earth minerals by more than 11 percent in the first half of 2011, further shrinking supplies of metals needed to make a range of high-tech products after Beijing slashed quotas for 2010.
Despite their name, rare earth elements are a relatively abundant group of 17 chemical elements. They were originally described as rare because they were unknown in their elemental form and difficult to extract from the rocks that contained them.
Glass - Cerium is the major constituent of this sector, where it is used in ultra-violet light filtering.
Polishing - A rapidly growing sector that is based on the unique chemical and mechanical properties of cerium in the polishing of glass, including multi-level electronic components.
Magnets - Currently, the most dynamic market for rare earths with growth in demand increasing at 15 percent a year for the past 10 years, causing neodymium and terbium to increase by more than 40 percent over the past 12 months.
Neodymium laser range-finders, guidance systems, communications
Rare earth magnets are widely used in wind turbines. Some large turbines require two short tonnes of rare earth magnets, which are very strong and make the turbines highly efficient. Rare earth magnets are used in turbines and generators in many alternative energy applications.
Every hybrid-electric and electric vehicle has a large battery which is made using several pounds of rare earth compounds. The use of electric vehicles is expected to increase rapidly, driven by energy independence, climate change and other concerns. This is a key growth area for rare earths.
MOBILE PHONES, LAPTOPS
Rechargeable batteries used in mobile phone and portable computers require rare earths, which were the key to smaller more efficient battery technology.

(1) to what extent is it ¡°not rare¡± because the term ¡°rare earth¡± is sloppily used to refer to a variety of essential raw material. (2) It might not be rare underground, but it¡¯s effectively rare when a manufacturer cannot make an order and get a prompt shipment from anywhere in the world. It takes 1 to 2 years before any new mine can produce rare earths. And that¡¯s not factoring in the rejection of licenses, delays due to rules categorizing certain rare earths as environmental hazards, etc etc.
