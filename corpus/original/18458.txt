(Reuters) - A senior Kuwaiti official said on Monday China has pledged to allow the Gulf state's sovereign wealth fund to trade on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in yuan currency, the official Kuwait News Agency reported.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao "also promised ... to grant the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) the privilege of local investor," the agency said citing remarks by KIA head Bader al-Saad, which manages the Gulf state's foreign portfolio.
Wen's pledge came during a meeting with Kuwait's Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah in Beijing during a state visit, it said.
"This would give us a strong impetus to enhance and diversify ... our investments in one of the most important global economies after were have been able to invest in the Hong Kong bourse in line with Chinese law," Saad said.
It will also allow qualified overseas firms to list on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, China's largest bourse, at an appropriate time, while supporting the issuance of yuan bonds by foreign banks incorporated in China, it added. (Reporting by Rania el Gamal; writing by Inal Ersan and Andre Grenon)
