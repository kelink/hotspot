(Reuters) - A deal to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) at this week's G8 summit could help secure a post-Kyoto treaty in December, the European Commission president said on Wednesday.
Jose Manuel Barroso said an agreement on the temperature target by the United States and others, notably developing economies, could "form the global benchmark and catalyst" for December's crunch climate change negotiations in Copenhagen.
"If you accept this (2 degrees), then the rest will come. It is logical," Barroso told Reuters on his flight to the three-day summit of industrialised and developing countries in the Italian city of L'Aquila.
"We are not there yet and there is still a long way to go in the 149 days after this summit to Copenhagen. But if we have this agreement, then we can fill in all the other lines."
He added: "These negotiations are always decided in the final metres and the last few metres are always difficult. But when you arrive in the final metres with these agreements already in place, real progress can be made."
Until now, the United States, Japan, Russia and Canada were unconvinced that a 2 degrees Celsius limit -- favoured by European G8 nations Germany, Britain, France and Italy -- was a level beyond which climate change would reach danger levels. But all G8 leaders adopted the temperature limit on Wednesday and the 17-member Major Economies Forum (MEF) was also expected to sign up to the idea at a meeting on Thursday on the sidelines of the main summit. G8 nations also agreed to reduce global carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2050 and urged wealthy countries to cut their emissions by 80 percent, diplomats said.
However, China and India blocked agreement by the MEF on the emissions goal according to the latest draft of their statement. -- For Reuters latest environment blogs click on:
