(Reuters) - U.S. manufacturer Honeywell hopes to win three more contracts on China's C919 civil aircraft program by the end of 2010, its regional head of Europe, Middle East and Africa said Monday.
Honeywell has already won three tenders for the upcoming C919, including its flight management system, which should bring in over $10 billion in revenue during the program's lifespan.
"We have submitted proposals for several mechanical and avionic parts. Final decisions should be made in the weeks to come," Paolo Carmassi said in an interview with Reuters at the Farnborough Air Show.
The C919 will be the biggest commercial plane ever made by China. With a maiden flight expected in 2014, the aircraft will compete against the single-aisle A320 made by Airbus and Boeing's B737, their most profitable planes.
Honeywell's French rivals Safran and Thales are also bidding for supply contracts on the C919. CFM International, a subsidiary of Safran and General Electric, won a multibillion-dollar deal to supply engines for the C919 in 2009.
Commenting on Honeywell's prospects for international expansion, Carmassi said the group wanted to expand in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Russia and India over the next few years, prioritizing organic growth but without excluding acquisitions on a case-by-case basis.
"These are the regions where we are concentrating our efforts," he said. "India has enormous infrastructure needs."
