Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza said he could not consider the case unless Polanski, who fled the United States for France after pleading guilty to rape, showed up in his court.
The lawyers have said they will appeal Espinoza's ruling on constitutional grounds, alleging that misconduct by the original prosecutors and the judge had deprived Polanski of his right to a fair hearing.
The director of "Rosemary's Baby" and "Chinatown" fled to France in the 1970s because he was convinced the judge in the case intended to send him to prison despite a plea agreement with prosecutors.
He has never set foot on U.S. soil since, even when he was awarded a best director Oscar for the 2002 Holocaust movie "The Pianist."
The teenager in the case, now a mother of three living in Hawaii, has said she believes Polanski's long exile from Hollywood has been punishment enough.
Polanski was one of the most respected movie makers in Hollywood in the late 1960s and 70s and won sympathy when his pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, was murdered in their Los Angeles home in 1969 by followers of Charles Manson.
