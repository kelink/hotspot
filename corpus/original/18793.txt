(Reuters) - An aircraft carrying 97 Chinese stranded in Mexico by the flu scare is expected to arrive in Shanghai late on Wednesday and all on board appear healthy, state media said.
The China Southern flight would touch down at Shanghai's Pudong airport at 4.35 p.m. (0845 GMT), later than scheduled as it was delayed by bad weather, Xinhua news agency said.
"Doctors are monitoring the passengers' health," the report quoted the airline as saying, describing them as being "in normal condition".
None of the 43 Mexicans that Beijing quarantined had shown symptoms of the H1N1 flu virus, prompting Mexico to accuse China of being "discriminatory".
China denied the charge, saying isolation was the correct procedure. [ID:nSP475284]
The row has strained what had been a warming relationship but, with Beijing courting Latin America as a trade and diplomatic partner, the damage appears unlikely to last.
Mexico is considered the epicentre of the flu outbreak, which has infected more than 1,490 people in 21 countries, sparking fears of a global pandemic. [ID:nN05520651]
The Chinese quarantines came after a Mexican man fell ill with the flu in Hong Kong, having arrived from Mexico via Shanghai.
