(Reuters) - China's Guilin Sanjin Pharmaceutical Co and Zhejiang Wanma Cable Co on Thursday said they would list shares on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on Friday, the first two initial public equity offerings in the Chinese stock market since last September.
Guilin Sanjin 002275.SZ, a traditional Chinese medicine maker, raised 910 million yuan ($133 million) in an IPO on June 29 to fund technical upgrades and product development, it said in a statement published in the official Securities Times.
But since the start of this year, China's benchmark SSE Composite stock index
has jumped more than 60 percent, pushing regulators to resume IPOs, partly in an effort to help cool a potentially overheating market.
) on Monday said it planned to raise up to 2 billion yuan in a public sale of new shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in mid-July to become China's first major IPO since last September.
State media on Wednesday said China State Construction Engineering Corp, the country's largest homebuilder, would raise as much as 42.6 billion yuan in a Shanghai IPO next month.
