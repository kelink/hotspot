) reported better-than-expected quarterly results, helped by a rise in shipments, and said it expects shipment growth to remain strong in the third quarter, sending its shares up 9 percent.
The company expects third-quarter shipments between 48 and 55 megawatts (MW). However, China Sunergy said the credit environment for solar products had not recovered at the rate it previously anticipated.
China Sunergy, like others in the solar space, has been hit hard by a dearth of financing for renewable energy projects and a global oversupply of solar panels that has sent prices on solar power products tumbling, eroding profits.
Blended average selling prices fell 12 percent sequentially to $1.44 per watt in the second quarter. On a conference call with analysts, the company said average selling prices and wafer costs had dropped roughly 10 percent to 12 percent so far in the third quarter.
Gross margins fell to 9.7 percent from 10.4 percent a year earlier, China Sunergy said, adding it expects margins in the third quarter to be flat sequentially.
"These margin levels have been impacted by a lower than expected average selling price and higher conversion costs during the third quarter, due to lower utilization rates," the company added.
For the latest second quarter, the company earned $1.7 million, or 4 cents per American Depositary Share (ADS), compared with a net loss of $3.1 million, or 8 cents per ADS, last year.
Excluding items, the company earned 3 cents per ADS.
Sales fell 37 percent to $70.1 million. Sequentially, however, total sales nearly doubled.
Analysts on average expected a profit of 1 cent a share, before items, on revenue of $60.7 million, according to Reuters Estimates.
Quarterly shipments came in at about 41.5 megawatt (MW), up 19 percent from last year, helped in part by expansion into new markets, the company said in a statement.
Shares of the company rose 9 percent before paring some gains to trade up 3 percent at $4.60 Thursday late morning on Nasdaq. The stock has more than tripled from a November 2008 year-low, but is still of more than 60 percent below its August 2008 year-high.
