"We should explore a better coordination of foreign exchange policies which would raise the question over the medium term of the balance of exchange rates and the role of currencies that have changed both as a result of the crisis and the role played by emerging market countries," Lagarde told reporters on the sidelines of a conference.
"When you see the development of international swaps made in currencies which are neither convertible (nor) transferable, in a certain way that means you are returning to bilateralism in commercial exchanges," Noyer, who is also a governing council member of the European Central Bank.
"We must avoid a return to the accumulation of foreign exchange," he said.
"That means that in order to compensate a lower accumulation of foreign exchange reserves we need ways to finance world activity, world trade, that's why we need to reinforce the resources of the IMF (International Monetary Fund)."
