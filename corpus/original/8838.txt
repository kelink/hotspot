) said on Thursday that it doesn't plan to sell off any more assets to pay down last year's debt taken on to finance the company's acquisition of Fording Canadian Coal Trust.
That means the company doesn't plan to part with its 20-percent stake in the Fort Hills oil sands project, which it had previously suggested it might sell.
"We don't expect to announce any additional sales," Teck Chief Executive Don Lindsay said on a conference call.
"We still need to close on some of the transactions that we've already announced, and that will bring our program of non-core asset sales to a close."
However, Lindsay said the company may still consider bringing on a strategic partner for its coal business.
The company took on $9.8 billion in bank loans to buy Fording, but actions such as the asset sales, a recent issuance of bonds, and sale of a 17-percent equity stake in the company to state-owned China Investment Corp have helped get the balance sheet under control.
The company's shares were up C$1.70, or 5.5 percent, at C$32.42 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
