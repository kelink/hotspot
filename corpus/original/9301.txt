(Reuters) - The Bank of Canada faces a different set of pressures than the Reserve Bank of Australia, which raised interest rates earlier this month, the governor of Canada's central bank said on Thursday.
Earlier this month, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) was the first central bank in the Group of 20 leading and emerging nations to raise its rates since the start of the global economic crisis.
"Anyone who is listening can see those differences pretty clearly in the policy stances of the two central banks ... we have tremendous respect for the RBA, to make it clear. We're not the RBA," he told a news conference.
* "We had a very sharp recession. They didn't have a recession."
* "They're blessed with a series of commodities that had a much stronger runup in price than ours have, and also many of which are priced on longer-term contracts."
* "They have acknowledged firmer price pressures than there are in this economy .. there is much less slack in the Australian economy than there is in the Canadian economy." (Reporting by David Ljunggren; editing by Peter Galloway)
