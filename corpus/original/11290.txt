(Reuters) - The impact of a Chinese lead poisoning scandal spread to another two provinces on Tuesday, threatening further cuts in supply from the world's top producer of the metal. [ID:nSP447110]
-- Chinese state media said on August 20 the number of children found with excess lead in their blood near the Wugang Manganese Smelting Plant in Hunan province reached 1,354. The Xinhua news agency reported close to 70 percent of 1,956 children tested had more than 100 milligrams of lead in each litre of blood.
-- The South China Morning Post reported in Sept. 2006 that 2,000 Chinese villagers from Gansu province, including 300 children, were being treated for lead poisoning which they say was caused by a local smelting plant.
-- The fine stemmed from the toymaker's 2007 recall of 95 types of toys and up to 2 million units, primarily for excessive lead in paint. The toys were made in China. Millions of Chinese-made toys were recalled in 2007, many by U.S. giant Mattel, mainly due to excessive levels of lead paint.
* SENEGAL -- Senegal's health ministry reported to the WHO in March 2008 that a total of 18 children died of lead poisoning between Oct. 2007 and Feb. 2008. Authorities banned a local industry recycling lead batteries and the WHO urged Dakar to decontaminate the suburb where nearly 1,000 residents were exposed to high concentrations of lead.
* WHO IS AT RISK?
-- All children under the age of six-years old are at risk because they are growing so rapidly and because they tend to put their hands or other objects, which may be contaminated with lead dust, into their mouths.
-- However, children living at or below the poverty line are at greatest risk. Additionally, children of some racial and ethnic groups and those living in older housing are disproportionately affected by lead.
-- Lead poisoning can build up slowly and occurs from repeated exposure to small amounts of lead which can harm a child's mental development. Health problems get more severe as the level of lead in the blood gets higher.
-- Lead is more harmful to children than adults because it can affect children's developing nerves and brains. The younger the child, the more harmful lead can be. Unborn children are the most vulnerable.
-- Possible complications include behaviour or attention problems, failure at school, hearing problems, kidney damage, reduced IQ and slowed body growth.
