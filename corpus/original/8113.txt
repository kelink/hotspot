(Reuters) - Rio Tinto (
) have not received any indications that the two mining giants will face regulatory issues in forming an iron ore production joint venture, the head of Rio's iron ore division said on Monday.
"It is very early days .. we have not received any indications of any issues from the European Commission," said Sam Walsh.
"Both sides have got teams that are working to that timeframe. I reviewed late last week the progress and I've got to say it's very encouraging," Walsh said.
The agreement is needed before the two groups can make a formal approach to regulatory bodies such as the European Commission, to have the joint venture plan approved.
When asked about comments from the China Iron and Steel Group last week that it expected to see a modest rise in iron ore prices in the next round of annual term talks, Walsh said "at the least we can agree on the direction of prices this time".
Walsh stressed that the joint venture only involved production of iron ore, with each firm to market its own ore to customers in Asia such as Chinese, Japanese and South Korean steel mills.
"It is now very clear that it is a production joint venture," he said.
The two iron ore miners in October scrapped a plan to co-market some iron ore from the proposed joint venture that had drawn criticism as being anti-competitive. (Reporting by Fayen Wong, Writing by Bruce Hextall; Editing by Lincoln Feast)
