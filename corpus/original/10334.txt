METALS-Copper slips, demand uncertainty dominates mood
2009-10-07 15:01:00.0
(Reuters) - Copper ended down a shade on Wednesday in thin and volatile trade during Chinese holidays, with rising stocks fueling uncertainty over demand against a fragile economic background.
Copper for December delivery HGZ9 on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division eased 0.50 cent to settle at $2.7795 a lb, after dealing in a session range between $2.7510 and $2.8040.
On the London Metal Exchange (LME), copper for three-month delivery MCU3 fell $21 to close at $6,095 a tonne.
Prices of the metal used in power and construction have doubled this year, driven by improving economic data, investor flows and Chinese stockpiling.
But sentiment has turned fragile in recent months as buying by China, the world's top copper consumer, has tailed off and demand from other world economies hampered by slowdown has yet to pick up the slack.
"There's been no effective economic growth caused by the stimulus in the West," said John Meyer, analyst at Fairfax investment bank.
"We haven't seen any major infrastructure projects," he added. "The only positive stimulus we've really seen is in China and nearby regions."

"There is some nervousness out there in front of that number that is keeping people a little bit to the sidelines today," said Sterling Smith, an analyst for Country Hedging Inc in St. Paul, Minnesota. "If Alcoa were to beat expectations, or up their guidance, or preferably both, I think that will be very bullish for copper, and for the industrial metals in general. I think you've got a lot of hands being kind of quiet today ahead of it." A recent bout of more encouraging economic data has helped underpin prices, including data showing German manufacturing orders rose slightly more than expected in August on a boost from foreign demand. [ID:nL7400974] STOCKS RISING Underlining demand concerns, LME copper stocks, which have climbed since mid-July, rose 725 tonnes to 347,150 tonnes -- their highest since May 2009. But recent dollar weakness is expected to support industrial metals as a lower U.S. currency makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies. And despite the dollar broadly firming on Wednesday, some analysts see the currency falling further.

Aluminum MAL3 ended at $1,845 from $1,822. Zinc MZN3 closed at $1,935 a tonne from $1,921 and battery material lead MPB3 at $2,155 from $2,150. Steel-making ingredient nickel MNI3 closed at $18,600 from $18,130 and tin MSN3 at $14,700 from $14,675. Latest LME data showed that a dominant position still holds more than 90 percent of tin stock warrants and cash contracts. The premium for cash material over the three-month future has fallen to $430 a tonne from $695 a tonne last week on talk that the position could be scaled back.
