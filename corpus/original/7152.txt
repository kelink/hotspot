(Reuters) - The euro slumped to five-month lows on Wednesday amid worries over Greece's fiscal woes and as global equity markets sold off as China, the world's growth engine, ordered banks to curb lending to cool its economy.
Crude oil futures dipped below $78 a barrel while copper, a proxy for Chinese growth, shed nearly 2 percent on fears that demand in China will slow as authorities tighten monetary policy.

On Wall Street, U.S. stocks slipped almost 2 percent before recouping some losses, but the Dow Jones industrial average still suffered its worst drop of 2010, while MSCI's all-country world index fell 1.6 percent. European stocks earlier closed down 1.5 percent.
IBM's earnings outlook for 2010 implies a slowdown in earnings-per-share growth compared to recent years, analysts said. Its shares slid 2.9 percent.
"You combine what's going on in China with the strength in the dollar and you have an unwind of the commodity trade," said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New York. "Then you throw in mediocre earnings relative to expectations and the market is taking a well-needed correction."
The CBOE Volatility index .VIX, Wall Street's favorite measure of investor fear, settled up more than 6.25 percent, but not before jumping more than 11 percent -- its biggest one-day jump in nearly two months -- as caution swirled.
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average
was down 122.28 points, or 1.14 percent, at 10,603.15, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index
was down 12.19 points, or 1.06 percent, at 1,138.04. The Nasdaq Composite Index

In currency markets, the euro fell as concerns intensified over cash-strapped Greece's ability to finance its mounting budget deficit, driving the cost of insuring against a Greek sovereign debt default to a record high.
"Concerns about Greece and the implications for the euro and the euro zone have been the catalyst for the dollar strength," said John McCarthy, director of foreign exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York.
The dollar was up against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY at 78.358, up 1.11 percent from a previous session close of 77.500.

U.S. government debt prices joined in a global upward trend, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note tracking the 10-year German bund. The 10-year note was up 10/32 in price to yield 3.66 percent.
