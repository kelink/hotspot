(Reuters) - News Corp has agreed to buy a stake in Chinese movie distributor Bona Film Group Ltd, becoming the latest U.S. media company to expand into China's booming movie market.
News Corp will take a 19.9 percent stake in Bona Film from founder and chief executive Yu Dong, Bona said in a statement. It gave no financial details. The Nasdaq-listed company has a market capitalization of about $392 million.
China, which posted box office revenue of $2.1 billion last year, agreed in February to open its market to more U.S. movies, adding 14 premium films, such as 3D or IMAX, to the current quota of 20 foreign films a year.
"China's film market is growing at a rapid pace, positioning the country to be the second-largest film market following the United States," Gao was quoted as saying.
Bona Film distributes films through most theatres in China, and owns and operates theatres in several large Chinese cities. It has also expanded into home video products, digital distribution and television.
"News Corporation's extensive global reach, investment and distribution will help accelerate our strategy to expand our global footprint," he said.
DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc, creator of "Kung Fu Panda", said in February it would build a production studio in Shanghai in a joint venture with three major Chinese media companies.
The venture, called Oriental Dreamworks, will develop and produce Chinese animated and live-action films for distribution in China and internationally.
