) is seeking $1.75 billion to $2 billion five-year financing for its subsidiary, Venetian Macau, almost one year after cancelling a $5.25 billion financing and mothballing its Macau projects, banking sources said.
Funds from the new-money deal will be used to complete Lot 5 and Lot 6 of the Venetian Macau development, sources familiar with the matter said.
The new financing follows news of Las Vegas Sands' plans to launch a $1.5 billion-$2 billion initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong in November, and some bankers suggested that plans for a committed financing to complete the mega development could be a boost ahead of that fundraising.
"This could be the good news story to go with the IPO -- a committed bank financing to finish the projects would remove the question mark over their completion," said a banker actively looking at the new deal. Banks said to be looking at the deal include Bank of China Macau, Bank National Ultramarino, Barclays Capital, Calyon, Citigroup (
), DBS Bank (
), Goldman Sachs (
), Mizuho Corporate Bank and UOB. Goldman is said to be the coordinator.
The $1.75 billion to $2 billion deal is said to be split between a revolving credit and a term loan, both with five-year tenors, according to sources who said they had seen the information package.
Las Vegas Sands is said to be requesting a margin of around 400 basis points over Libor for the project financing deal, and to be looking for commitments of $200 million-$300 million from individual banks.
