(Reuters) - The global economic crisis could change the entire landscape of the luxury goods industry, the former chief executive of iconic British clothing retailer Aquascutum said on Tuesday.
"There could be a whole turnaround in some of the bigger companies becoming smaller companies and some of the smaller businesses, that are actually better at listening to the customer, becoming more of the medium-sized businesses," said Kim Winser at the Reuters Global Luxury Summit in London.
"Some of the luxury brands have seen a lot of growth over the last couple of decades relatively easily. I think they're (now) going to have to work that much harder at it," she said.
"I really like the idea that the customer's going to be in the driving seat."
Winser, who stepped down as Aquascutum's CEO last month after a management buy-out collapsed, thinks accessories will emerge from the downturn first with apparel lagging behind.
"There's demand building in China, there's demand building in India, there is some demand building in certain Middle Eastern countries," she added.
