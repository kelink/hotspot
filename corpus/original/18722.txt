UPDATE 2-Weaker demand weighs on Brazil miner Vale's profit

(Reuters) - The world's biggest iron ore producer, Brazil's Vale, posted first-quarter net profit of $1.36 billion on Thursday, down one third from $2.02 billion a year ago as the economic crisis hit demand for the steel ingredient.
), one of the world's top three miners, said earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- a key measure of cash flow known as EBITDA -- fell to $2.28 billion from $3.7 billion a year earlier under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
Net earnings were barely changed from the fourth quarter of 2008, reaching $1.36 billion reais compared with $1.37 billion then when the global economic plunge had already taken hold.
Analysts had predicted Vale, one of the world's top three miners, would post a net profit of $1.34 billion and EBITDA of $2.45 billion for the quarter, according to the average forecast of five analysts surveyed by Reuters.
The company cut iron ore output by 10 percent, or about 30 million tonnes, and idled six pellet plants equating to about a third of pellet capacity in response to a sudden drop in demand for iron ore after the global economic crisis erupted.
It also shut down nickel mining operations in Ontario, Canada, for an eight-week period.
The average price Vale received for iron ore fell to $62.79 per tonne from $73.92, due to an increase in sales to Asian clients where it has enacted temporary discounts of up to 20 percent on the benchmark rate.
Announcing the discounts last month, Vale said the measure would align its rates more closely with the spot price and stir weak demand.
"Except for China, demand for iron ore remains extremely weak, with Japan, the second-biggest importer, reducing its purchases by 34.4 percent," compared to the first quarter of 2008, Vale said in its earnings report.
Iron ore output for the company fell 37 percent in the first quarter from a year ago, while its pellets production fell 73 percent, Vale reported in late April.
Dwindling demand for steel and other commodities also forced the company to cut 1,300 jobs in December and force another 5,500 to take any paid leave they were entitled to between December and March.
Revenue from nickel, copper and other non-ferrous metals fell by more than half to $1.51 billion from $3.38 billion in the same quarter a year ago, and down from $2.07 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Vale said earlier this year that it was on track to export a record amount of iron ore to Asia in the first quarter, after signing on many new steel mills in China to supply contracts. China on Wednesday said it had imported a record 53.5 million tonnes of ore in April. [ID:nSHA197589]
Vale's earnings report showed revenue from China jumped by more than $1 billion in the period from the same quarter of 2008 and it consolidated its position as the company's top customer, buying two thirds of Vale's iron ore and pellets.
By contrast, sales to North and South America and Europe more than halved in the first three months of the year compared to the same period of 2008.
Vale said net debt totaled $6.2 billion, down sharply from the $18.3 billion it owed by the end of March 2008. Investments in the first quarter were up slightly, rising to $1.72 billion compared to $1.7 billion in the year-ago period.
In Brazil's currency, the real, earnings reached 3.15 billion, compared with 3.18 billion in the first quarter of 2008. The real was much weaker in the first quarter this year, so Vale's sales, mostly in dollars, boosted the figure. (Reporting by Peter Murphy; Editing by Carol Bishopric)
