The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the news and said it was part of a broad effort to put cash to work, and that the hefty injection would be welcome news for hedge funds.
The paper, citing unnamed sources, said that CIC Chairman Lou Jiwei worries about missing investment opportunities as the market nears a bottom.
CIC has been approached by hedge fund managers, including Eton Park Capital Management's Eric Mindich and Paulson & Co's John Paulson, the paper reported.
