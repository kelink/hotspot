) said on Friday there have been no interruptions to its production or sales if indium, contradicting talk in the European market that the company had run out of the metal, used in making liquid crystal displays.
"Our production and sales are normal," said Teck spokeswoman Catherine Hart.
Hunan, one of the China's top indium producers, has shut down almost all of its crude indium production this month due to an environmental investigation at its smelters, traders said on Friday.
That helped drive weekly Indium prices up by 10 percent to 2,950 to 3,100 yuan ($431.9-$453.8) a tonne in Shanghai.
Meanwhile, European traders told Reuters on Friday there were concerns the company had run out of the metal.
Vancouver, British Columbia-based Teck is one of the world's top producers of the metal, which is a byproduct of the zinc smelting process and is used to make liquid crystal displays.
Teck reduced zinc metal output by 20 percent last year due to plunging demand, but plans to restore production in September. The company's main products are copper, zinc, and metallurgical coal, which is used in the steelmaking process.
Teck's shares were up 37 Canadian cents at C$27.55 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
