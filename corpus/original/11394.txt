"I think this could be just the start for me," Ozaki, 28, told Monday's Japanese media after finishing behind China's Bai Xue in Berlin on Sunday. "There's more to come from me in the future."
A tearful Ozaki, whose career was in doubt two years ago, hugged Sachiko Yamashita after matching her coach's silver medal at the 1991 world championships in Tokyo.
"It's a shame I couldn't go one better," said Ozaki. "It was only at 30 kilometres when I saw the other runners were suffering I thought I could win a medal."
Ozaki visited former Olympic champion Naoko Takahashi's Colorado home before the Berlin championships to spend time in an oxygen chamber to help her recovery from nagging injuries.
She paid tribute to Yamashita, who celebrated her 45th birthday three days before Sunday's race.
"I wrote in her card 'Thank you for picking up a tortoise like me' and that I wanted to party again after winning a medal," said Ozaki. "It still hasn't sunk in."
Takahashi's gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics was followed by Mizuki Noguchi's sensational victory at the 2004 Athens Games but Japan has experienced a major title drought since.
