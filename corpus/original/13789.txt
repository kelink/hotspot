(Reuters) - State-owned CNPC, China's leading oil and gas company, aims to double its natural gas production in seven years, according to a newsletter published by the company on Friday. CNPC, the parent of PetroChina (
), said it planned to produce 120 billion cubic metres of natural gas by 2015 and 150 billion cubic metres by 2020, which would enable the oil heavyweight to take half of the country's gas market.
The company produced 61.7 billion cubic metres of natural gas in 2008, up 13.8 percent from 54.2 billion cubic metres in 2007, according to Reuters calculations.
CNPC also aims to prove 400 billion cubic metres of natural gas reserves per year during the next 10 years, the newsletter cited Zhou Xinyuan, president of a CNPC subsidiary in Xinjiang, as saying.
Another company official revealed that CNPC would bring its total natural gas pipeline to 50,000 kilometres from the current 23,000 kilometres by 2020, according to the newsletter published on its web site www.cnpc.com.cn.
That would increase the annual handling capacity of CNPC's gas pipeline to 210 billion cubic metres in 2020 from 60 cubic metres, it said.
CNPC had a total 30,000 kilometres of oil and gas pipelines. Its gas pipelines accounted for about 89 percent of the national total, it said.
Beijing has set 196 million tonnes and 198 million tonnes of crude oil production as national targets for 2010 and 2011, respectively.
For natural gas, the output goals for 2010 and 2011 are 105 billion and 120 billion cubic metres, respectively.
China aims to produce 192 million tonnes of crude oil and 86 billion cubic metres of natural gas in 2009, up 1.2 percent and 13 percent, respectively, from last year.
