(Reuters) - A number of regional as well as top coal miners have signed annual coal supply deals with the country's five largest power producers after eight months of negotiations, Chinese media quoted an industry body as saying.
"Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Shandong, Anhui, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Shenhua Group and China Coal Group have signed key thermal coal supply contracts with the top five power groups," Liu Caiying, vice chairwoman of the China National Coal Association, was quoted as saying by Shanghai Securities News.
But a power industry executive at one of the top five generating firms denied such a development, saying miners and power firms remained deadlocked on the 2009 term deals over prices, except in a few provinces.
"The price miners asked for is too high, and we would have no way out if we signed annual deals at that price. Now we can still control the cost through the physical market," said the executive, who declined to be named.
) has insisted this year's contract price for coal with calorific value of 5,500 kcal/kg (NAR) should rise to 540 yuan ($79.1) a tonne, or 17 percent higher than last year.
The executive told Reuters that the power companies were still in talks with miners in a number of regions including Shanxi, Shaanxi and Henan, while using the spot market and imports, which have surged to record highs in recent months, to help secure supply.
China liberalised coal prices in 2006 after years of government control, but power tariff is still set by the government.
Earlier in the summer, the top five state-owned power groups -- Huaneng, Datang, Guodian, Huadian and China Power Investment, signed the 2009 coal supply contracts with miners in a few provinces including Shandong and Guizhou, with prices up 4 percent on the year, or flat after tax effects.
