(Reuters) - Marine engineering group Hamworthy Plc HAMW.L said on Thursday it remained confident of meeting estimates for the current financial year, helped by a robust order book and cost cuts at a unit including job reductions.
Hamworthy said its forecast for the year ending March 31, 2010 was subject to foreign exchange rates.
"As at June 30, Hamworthy continues to have good near-term visibility and sales coverage through its robust order book, which stood at 222 million pounds," the company said.
Hamworthy said its order intake for new product sales remained slow as expected, with a total order intake of 29 million pounds ($47.6 million) for the first quarter to June.
Its pump systems division won a 3 million pounds order for pump room and engine room pump systems for five tankers to be built in China for the Indonesian state-owned oil and gas company Pertamina, Hamworthy said.
The gas systems division secured a 3 million pounds order, also in China, for its liquid petroleum gas handling system, the company said.
