(Reuters) - Gold hit a record high above $1,110 an ounce on Monday as the dollar tumbled on expectations of low U.S. interest rates, boosting bullion's appeal as a hedge against a falling U.S. currency.
The precious metal extended last week's gains of nearly 5 percent, when fund buying took it to record highs after India's central bank bought 200 tonnes of gold from the International Monetary Fund and the dollar weakened further.
Nicholas Brooks, head of research and investment strategy at ETF Securities, said that gold rallied on expectations of continued monetary easing following a G20 meeting over the weekend.
"Investors have become concerned about the outlook for paper currencies and also for inflation. The natural move in this kind of environment is into gold," Brooks said.
Equities, oil and other commodities also rallied on Monday. The S&P 500 index rose for a sixth straight session as the dollar index fell to a 15-month low after the Group of 20 pledged to keep emergency stimulus spending in place.
Spot gold was at $1,100.85 an ounce at 2:08 p.m. EST (1908 GMT), against $1,096.30 in New York late Friday. Earlier in the session, bullion reached a record high of $1,110.85 an ounce
U.S. December gold settled up $5.70 at $1,101.40 an ounce on the COMEX division of the NYMEX.
Deutsche Bank trader Michael Blumenroth said some inflation fears are starting to be felt, while the weak dollar remains the key driver of the market. "People are expecting more weakness there," he said.
"In general, the rally looks healthy," he added.

GOLD RISES IN ALL CURRENCIES?
Traders noted that gold's strength in currencies other than the U.S. dollar suggested gains could be resilient.
Gold priced in euros held near its highest since March at 740.69 on Monday, while sterling-denominated gold hit 662.48 pounds, within reach of eight-month highs.
Among other precious metals, silver was at $17.49 an ounce versus $17.38, platinum at $1,353 an ounce versus $1,342.50, and palladium at $330 against $327.50.
Both platinum and palladium held near the multimonth highs they hit in late October as traders bet strength in gold prices and an expected recovery in demand from carmakers, the major consumers of the platinum group metals, will buoy prices.
Data released on Monday showed China's passenger car sales surged 75.8 percent in October from a year earlier, extending the explosive growth of recent months as government incentive policies continued to lure customers.
