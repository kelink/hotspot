(Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke said on Friday he will travel to China this year to promote sales of U.S. clean energy goods as part of the Obama administration's effort to fight global warming.
"This would be a win-win for jobs in the United States, as well as addressing a very serious problem of the planet," Locke told Reuters in an interview.
President Barack Obama also has placed a big priority on passing legislation this year to reduce greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming, as well as reaching a new international accord to cut the emissions.
Locke's trade mission, which a U.S. government official said is targeted for September, is one of several high-level U.S.-China contacts planned this year.
The last is a meeting in Beijing between U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao that could take place in November, around the time of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Singapore.
The U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, led on the U.S. side by the State and Treasury departments, is tentatively scheduled for late July, the U.S. government official said.
Another forum, the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade is slated for late October.
