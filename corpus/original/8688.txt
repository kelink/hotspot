Japan foreign minister trip to U.S. not set: media

(Reuters) - A trip by Japan's foreign minister to Washington to try to soothe strained ties ahead of President Barack Obama's visit was up in the air on Monday after Japanese media said the U.S. side had retracted its announcement of planned talks with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
A feud over the repositioning of a U.S. Marine air base on Japan's southern island of Okinawa has strained relations between the two close security allies ahead of Obama's November 12-13 visit.
Japanese media said the U.S. State Department had included talks with Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada in Clinton's announced schedule for November 6, but later deleted the item after being told by Tokyo the timing was still under discussion.
Kyodo news agency said Okada was still likely travel to Washington for talks, but added that the timing was being complicated by his parliamentary schedule.
The United States has said the 2006 base relocation deal must go ahead as part of a broader realignment of U.S. troops, but Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama wants time to review the deal as promised by his Democratic Party ahead of its landslide election victory in August.
Hatoyama's Democrats have pledged to steer a more independent course from Washington, raising concerns about the alliance, long central to security arrangements in a region home to a rising China and an unpredictable North Korea.
