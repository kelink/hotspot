) this week, a source briefed on the situation told Reuters on Monday.
ANZ was expected to pay about A$930 million ($775 million), the source added, for buying RBS's retail and commercial banking operations in six Asian countries, a figure which JP Morgan analysts also estimated ANZ would pay for the assets.
"I think it will happen this week at some stage. This week is more likely," the source said. The source declined to be identified as the negotiations were confidential.
ANZ was pursuing assets in Hong Kong, Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam and Taiwan, the source added.
ANZ was not in talks to buy RBS's Indian and Chinese businesses, the source said.
"China and India just proved to be too difficult given that ANZ doesn't have banking licence (for those countries) at this moment," the source added.
An RBS spokeswoman in Hong Kong said: "We are well advanced with the sale process, however due to regulatory constraints and the confidentiality of the process we will not be commenting on any individual bidders or elements of the transaction process until its completion."
