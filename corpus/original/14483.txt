"The business license has come at a critical time for China's financial markets, over a period in which Deutsche Bank has continued to invest and commit capital," Lee Zhang, Group Chairman of Deutsche Bank China, said in the statement.
China also plans to launch a Nasdaq-style second board, expand its corporate bond market and establish Shanghai as a global financial centre by 2020.
The business license, granted by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, will initially allow Deutsche Bank's venture to underwrite and sponsor yuan-denominated A shares and foreign investment shares, as well government and corporate bonds.
