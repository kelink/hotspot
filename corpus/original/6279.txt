Vietnam, China and other countries have longstanding competing claims of sovereignty over parts of the sea, including the potentially oil- and gas-rich Spratly and Paracel island chains.
U.S. military officials have singled out China's naval buildup and activities in the area as a concern both to the United States and its Asian partners.
"The South China Sea is an area of growing concern. This sea is not only vital to those directly bordering it, but to all nations with economic and security interests in Asia," Gates told a security conference in Singapore.
He said the United States believed it was essential to maintain "stability, freedom of navigation, and free and unhindered economic development" in the sea, and objected to "any effort to intimidate U.S. corporations or those of any nation engaged in legitimate economic activity."
"We do not take sides on any competing sovereignty claims," Gates said, urging all sides to "work to resolve differences through peaceful, multilateral efforts."
Admiral Robert Willard, head of the U.S. military's Pacific Command, cited China's increased maritime "assertiveness" in the South China Sea and East China Sea as a concern and "increasing encounters" with neighbors in the region, including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Japan.
