(Reuters) - The chief executive of Germany's second-largest listed steelmaker sharply criticised rivals like Arcelor Mittal (
"It is unlikely that the steel market reaches the 2007 level prior to 2012," Salzgitter (
) Chief Executive Wolfgang Leese told the Financial Times Deutschland in an interview published on Thursday, adding that he saw little room for price increases in the coming months.
Leese attributed the long-term problems facing steelmakers to one of his main customers, the automotive industry. The very existence of roughly 30-50 percent of auto part suppliers were threatened, according to Leese.
"We only have a small temporary peak that in my view willl last until the end of the year roughly," he continued, referring to demand stemming from inventory restocking.
"It is incomprehensible that steelmakers are starting to ramp up their blast furnaces," Leese explained. The Salzgitter CEO is known in the analyst community for his cautious views and sometimes extremely conservative forecasts.
Leese said he could not say when his own third blast furnace, which has been out of operation since the end of March, would be brought back on line.
While electric arc furnaces found in mini-mills recycle scrap steel, the blast furnaces in conventional steel mills create new, or primary, steel from iron ore.
However, market participants are divided as to whether the capacity start-ups are too much and too quick as end-user consumption remains poor and is not likely to strengthen before mid-2010.
Steel prices have risen over the past couple of months due to improved orders and as mills pushed for higher prices. But the price rally have paused recently, particularly in China, the world's top producer and consumer of the metal, as the buying faded away.
