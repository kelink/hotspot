(Reuters) - America Movil, Latin America's leading mobile telephone operator, expects email and Internet browsing to make up about a quarter of its overall revenue within three years, Chief Financial Officer Carlos Garcia-Moreno said on Tuesday.
Increasingly affordable and sophisticated mobile telephones will let even low-income clients in Latin America surf the Internet or check their email while on the go, Garcia-Moreno said, speaking at the Reuters Latin American Investment Summit in Mexico City.
Mexico City-based America Movil, which surprised investors last month with strong quarterly results and subscriber additions despite tough world economic conditions, is betting hard on its 3G services, available in the 18 countries where it operates.
), part of the empire of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, will use a $1 billion loan it recently got from China Development Bank to buy from China's largest telecoms equipment maker, Huawei Technologies.
"With the stock so cheap, what makes the most sense for generating value for our shareholders is to buy back our own shares," he said.
After steep losses in October last year as the world credit crisis hit financial markets, America Movil's stock is up 13 percent in 2009, outperforming a less than 3 percent gain in Mexico's IPC benchmark stock index. The company's shares were down 0.64 percent to 23.46 pesos on Tuesday.
