(Reuters) - Sinopec Corp's (
) expanded 240,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Fujian refinery, a joint venture with Saudi Aramco and Exxon Mobil Corp (
), started pumping crude into its new facility late April, an industry source told Reuters on Thursday.
The refinery, part of a $5 billion venture that includes a petrochemical complex, was expected to reach normal operating rates as early as July, said the source.
The start-up, delayed from the last quarter of 2008, comes as Chinese state refiners are enjoying improved refining margins under a new fuel-pricing system and earlier ballooned fuel stocks have thinned.
"There is no more reason for further delay, except that the plant has to watch out for domestic fuel demand and how the economic situation is evolving to decide on operation ratios when it passes the test period," said the source.
Top refiner Sinopec Corp, which owns 50 percent of the venture, has planned regular maintenance this month at several major plants such as Zhenhai and Guangzhou to allow for the new refinery to start runs. [ID:nSP398110]
Among recent signs of recovery in oil demand, diesel stocks held by the country's top two oil conmpanies fell 16 percent in March from February, while gasoline dropped 20 percent, a newsletter run by Xinhua reported, the first major decrease after China amassed brimming stocks ahead of 2008 Beijing Olympics.
China is also seen topping up crude stocks with its main ports bringing in 9 percent more foreign crude in April than a year earlier in its first increase this year, a paper run by the Ministry of Communications said on Tuesday.
