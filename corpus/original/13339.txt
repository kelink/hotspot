(Reuters) - China's Everbright Securities will begin book-building on Tuesday for the country's second ever initial public offering (IPO) by a securities brokerage.
The medium-sized broker, worth around 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) and controlled by China's second biggest financial conglomerate China Everbright Group and its Hong Kong-listed unit China Everbright Ltd (
), plans to issue up to 520 million shares, or 15.21 percent of expanded capital after the IPO, for a listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
It would use the proceeds to expand its network of stock trading offices, upgrade technology, develop overseas business and consolidate its capital base, it said in a prospectus published on Sunday on the exchange's website, www.sse.com.cn.
Shanghai-based Everbright Securities said it had appointed Orient Securities in Shanghai as the IPO's lead underwriter.
China has eight listed brokerages, but only one, CITIC Securities (
), went public in 2002 by floating IPO shares. Six others chose backdoor listings via acquisitions of listed companies, and the other transformed itself into a brokerage from a previous trust firm.
Now a slew of other brokerages, including China Merchants Securities and Industrial Securities, are considering IPOs as China's stock market, which has boomed for most of the past several years, is offering good opportunities for expansion.
