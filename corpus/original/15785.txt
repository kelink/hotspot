Yao calls for young blood in China team

(Reuters) - Yao Ming has called for an infusion of new blood in the Chinese national basketball team to ensure they can cope when he eventually brings his international career to a close, local media reported on Thursday.
The Houston Rockets center will not play for China at this August's Asia Championships because of a foot injury and said last year that the Beijing Games would be his last Olympics.
"I think chances should always be given to young players. However long time I could play, one day I will retire," he told Shanghai TV.
The 7ft 6in (2.29m) Yao injured his left foot during the NBA playoffs last month. He had a series of serious injuries in 2005 and 2006 and underwent surgery for a stress fracture on the left foot before last year's Olympics.
"I've seen many players still playing in the national team at the age of 30. But it was different that they did not play in a league as intense as the one I do," he said.
The Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) are determined to reclaim the Asian title they lost two years ago, and have confirmed that 31-year-old former NBA player Wang Zhizhi would be in the squad.
Sun Yue, the 23-year-old LA Lakers guard, has also been ordered by the CBA to return home for the continental tournament in Tianjin from August 6-16 instead of participating in the NBA Summer League.
Yao, who has never been beyond the Western Conference semi-finals in six years with the Rockets, admitted to some envy of his compatriot's championship ring.
"I am a bit jealous, it would be heartless to stay indifferent," he said.
