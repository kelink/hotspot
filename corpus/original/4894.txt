Factbox: China's fledgling shale gas sector

(Reuters) - China's No.3 oil and gas firm, CNOOC Ltd, announced a second shale gas deal with Chesapeake Energy, agreeing to buy a 33.3 percent stake in the U.S. firm's leasehold acres in Colorado and Wyoming for $570 million.
CNOOC also agreed to fund 66.7 percent of Chesapeake's share of drilling and completion costs until an additional $697 million is paid, which Chesapeake expects will happen by end of 2014.
China's Ministry of Land & Resource (MRL) will hold its first auction of 8 shale gas blocks in the first quarter of 2011, two more than first planned and behind an earlier schedule for November last year.
With the planned auction only open to domestic energy firms, the MRL added more qualifying participants, including Sinochem, Xinjiang Guanghui and Zhenhua, beyond the original list of PetroChina, Sinopec, CNOOC and Shaanxi Yanchang.
On Jan 21, Sinochem signed an agreement with Hess Corp to cooperate in shale oil and gas in China, in an apparent effort to beef up its capacity to break into the new frontier in China.
Encouraged by the boom in shale natural gas drilling in the U.S. and driven by recurring domestic gas shortages, China has fast-tracked plans to explore the unconventional fuel, part of a massive push to boost gas consumption to cut down heavy dependence on dirtier coal.
So far the sector remains at its early stage with a small number of pilot wells drilled, but it has attracted strong interest from international oil firms such as Shell, BP, Exxon Mobil and Conocophillips.
The following are some facts Reuters gathered to sum up China's shale gas sector, according to company announcements and state media reports.
MRL, in charge of resource registrations and management of mining rights, has set ambitious targets. Early 2010, a research arm under the Ministry set a target for the country to identify 50-80 shale gas prospects and 20-30 exploration and development blocks by 2020.
The Strategic Research Center for Oil and Gas also set a goal to locate one trillion cubic meters of recoverable shale gas reserves, build 15-30 billion cubic meters of production capacity and produce 8-12 percent of China's natural gas from shale plays by 2020.
MLR's targets may serve as a reference to the industry, which is dominated by powerful energy giants PetroChina and Sinopec, each of which has set their own goals, which are more modest versus those by the ministry.
China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), which runs most gas and oil businesses via listed PetroChina, aims to produce 500 million cubic meters (mcm) of shale gas by 2015, a deputy general manager said in July.
China's Sichuan basin, Erdos basin, Bohai Bay, Songliao basin, Jianghan basin, Tuha basin, Tarim basin and Junggar basin, mostly in the west and north, may hold shale gas.
The upstream regions of the Yangtze River valley, which include southern and eastern parts of Sichuan province, southeastern parts of Chongqing, northern parts of Guizhou and western parts of Hubei, are likely to contain sizeable deposits, according to preliminary estimates by MRL.
* Dec 2010, Sinopec struck shale gas flows in two exploration wells last December central and southernwestern China, in the state energy firm's early experiments with the unconventional resource.
* Dec 2010, PetroChina and Royal Dutch Shell have started drilling the first evaluation well Yang 101 in a shale gas block Fushun-YOngchuan in Sichuan province.
* Aug 2010, ConocoPhillips was reported to be in advanced talks with PetroChina over the development of a 3,000 square kilometres shale gas block between Chengdu, capital of southwestern Sichuan province, and Chongqing municipality.
* June 2010, Sinopec's southern exploration unit set up a shale gas exploration arm that eyes exploration breakthrough in 2-3 years and start industrial-level development of the gas in 3-5 years.
* May 2010, government officials said Beijing will likely offer subsidies and tax incentives to shale gas production, similar to that of coal seam gas whose production enjoys up to 0.33 yuan ($0.0485) per cubic meters of financial aid. But such policies have yet won final government approval.
* May 2010, Sinopec said shale fracturing at its Fangshen 1 well in Guizhou province was a success, the first such operation in China. The firm did not give further details.
* May 2010, China and the United States announced the two nations would cooperate in areas including shale gas, smart grid, clean coal, renewable energy, nuclear power and electric cars.
* Jan 2010, Sinopec was reported in talks with BP over potential cooperation in the exploration and development of a 2,000-square-kilometre shale gas block in Kaili in Guizhou province and a 1,000-square-kilometre block in Huangqiao in the northern part of Jiangsu province.
* Nov 2009, an MRL unit drilled a test well in southwestern Chongqing and confirmed shale gas deposits.
* Nov 2009, PetroChina and Royal Dutch Shell agreed to jointly evaluate shale gas reserves of the Fushun-Yongchuan block in Sichuan basin.
* Oct 2007, Houston-based Newfield Exploration Co agreed to jointly study with PetroChina shale gas resources at the Weiyuan field in the Sichuan basin in southwestern China.
