(Reuters) - Aluminum Corp of China Ltd (
), the world's No. 3 alumina producer, said it aims to break even by year-end after posting a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss, which sent its shares lower on Tuesday.
China's top alumina and aluminium producer, also known as Chalco (
), recorded gross losses in all segments in the first half of the year, resulting in higher production costs on a low utilisation rate, analysts said.
The company announced its results late on Monday, including a second-quarter loss that was four times bigger than analysts had expected. [ID:nPEK188870]
"The results are disappointing and it's a big miss against our forecast of a breakeven in the second quarter," said Becky Yuen, a research analyst at GuocoCapital.
Chalco shares retreated on Tuesday after the company's poor results shattered investor hopes for a speedy recovery. They were down 2.7 percent in Hong Kong and 5 percent in Shanghai at 0338 GMT.
But Chalco, whose state-owned parent Chinalco failed to clinch a $19.5 billion equity tie-up deal with Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto (
) in June, is optimistic about aluminium pricing.
Chalco forecast global aluminium prices to hold at $1,800 to $2,300 per tonne for the rest of the year against an LME aluminium price MAL3 of around $1,920 per tonne on Tuesday.
Domestic prices were expected to range from 14,000 yuan ($2,049) to 16,000 yuan per tonne, company president Luo Jianchuan told a news conference.
"We must work hard not to lose money in the second half and from the full-year perspective we will try to end the losses that we saw in the first half," Chalco chairman Xiong Weiping told reporters.
It missed an average forecast of a 445 million yuan loss from six analysts polled by Reuters, and compared with a restated profit of 1.14 billion yuan in the same period last year.
For the first half, Chalco posted a loss of 3.52 billion yuan against a restated profit of 2.39 billion yuan a year earlier.
) also reported a third consecutive quarterly loss in July, but cost cuts helped the largest U.S. aluminium maker beat estimates by a large margin. [ID:nN08471164]
Optimism that aluminium demand and prices were rebounding helped Chalco's shares more than double this year, beating a 40 percent rise in the broader market
Chalco now trades at 1.9 times book value for 2010 with return on equity of 4 percent and 49.8 times 2010 earnings, Morgan Stanley estimated.
"The shares appear even less attractive to us compared with Alcoa at 25 times (p/e)," it said in a research note on Tuesday.
Chalco's plan to sell up to 1 billion new A shares and idled capacity restarts are expected to weigh on its shares.
China, the world's biggest consumer of aluminium, has led a recovery in demand, helped largely by Beijing's 4 trillion yuan stimulus package.
Aluminium hit a record high of $3,380 per tonne in July 2008 before collapsing to $1,300 per tonne in February amid fears of a further deterioration in the global economy.
