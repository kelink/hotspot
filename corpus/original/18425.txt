(Reuters) - Animal feed and pork company AgFeed Industries Inc FEED.O reported a surge in first-quarter profit, sending its shares up 15 percent.
"I think what it (H1N1 scare) did is that it contributed to lessening the demand in an already weak pricing environment. You had seasonal impact, and you had this sort of scare on top of it," Rodman and Renshaw analyst Joey Giamichael said by phone.
World Health Organisation (WHO) laboratories have confirmed 4,694 infections with the new strain of H1N1 flu, which the United Nations agency said on Monday has killed at least 53 people.
A total of 30 countries have had infections with the new flu strain that is a genetic mixture of swine, bird and human viruses.
AgFeed also said hog prices will continue at low levels until late summer, but added prices will begin to climb by September as the Chinese economy accelerates.
Giamichael said pricing improvement over the course of the year, coupled with sustained volumes by the company, would "dramatically" increase profitability.
For the latest first quarter, the company earned $3 million, or 8 cents a share, compared with $919,297, or 3 cents a share, last year. Revenue nearly tripled to $33.4 million.
Analysts on average were looking for earnings of 5 cents a share, before items, on revenue of $37.2 million, according to Reuters estimates.
Shares of the company were up 15 percent at $4.58 Monday morning on Nasdaq, before paring gains to trade at $4.42.
